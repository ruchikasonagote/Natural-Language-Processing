Browsing /r/all and seeing this, I'm impressed how many of you at skeptical of American media and rightfully so! 

This one is loads worse than u thought. 


I did a Google search to find more pictures of this event to see if he was making that face a lot or if it could be a joke or momentary something 


I found... Not a single photo which wasn't taken at this moment. On Google. The search returned some badly times photos like this and then random other photos. Ok. 

So I searched for a video of the handshake. The ONLY results Google returned to me were edited clips that ONLY showed the awkward part. 


So I had to find a video of the whole ceremony and find this part... 


https://youtu.be/3GtSorFUQhc @ 56:40

You can see that he fucks up the hand positioning for about 3 seconds or so, then realized and fixed it, and it looks to me like he's making the face as a joke. 

But all Google would show me is unflattering stills and edited videos and about 20 articles about how Trump fucked it up soooooooooooooo bad. 


Like the first feeding lie I fucking hate how our media just thinks it can get away with absolute bullshit fabrications. And the problem is... They can get away with it.

American ""yoga"" which is a mocking commercialized stolen portion of Indian religious practice into a money making exercise fad IS NOT REAL YOGA.

So saying the Indian man is ""flexible"" due to ""yoga"" is obviously referencing the American kind. 

ASANAS ARE A TINY AND NON ESSTNTIAL PART OF YOGA.

Proper raja yoga which uses asanas is done in ONE asana and the spiritual part is done purely in the mind through meditation.

American ""yoga"" is literally stealing a religious practice, bastardizing it, misunderstanding it and selling mats and lessons at studios.

As the Washington Post's Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher explained in a recent book:

After college, after Trump mostly gave up his personal athletic interests, he came to view time spent playing sports as time wasted. Trump believed the human body was like a battery, with a finite amount of energy, which exercise only depleted. So he didn‚Äôt work out. When he learned that John O‚ÄôDonnell, one of his top casino executives, was training for an Ironman triathlon, he admonished him, ""You are going to die young because of this.""

*****************

From NY Times

Trump said he was not following any special diet or exercise regimen for the campaign. ""All my friends who work out all the time, they‚Äôre going for knee replacements, hip replacements‚Äîthey‚Äôre a disaster,"" he said. 

He exerts himself fully by standing in front of an audience for an hour, as he just did. ""That‚Äôs exercise.""",8,2,1510766253.0,TA_Account_12,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral

A joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh and is not meant to be taken seriously. It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a punch line. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a pun or other word play such as irony, a logical incompatibility, nonsense, or other means.

dpvk63a,"> whether Colbert is guilty of *exactly* the same sins on*exactly* the same day as his merry band of establishment lapdogs is not the point.

It is actually the point I was making. This is about critical discipline. Generalizations are useful abstractions. But they are, by definition, *inaccurate* (imprecise). It is extremely important to recognize the exceptions (and *keep* recognizing the exceptions) as individuals and as a society, because the imprecision of generalizations is inherently deceptive‚Äîeven if the generalization is generally true.

If the only times we recognize a journalist are for their poor reporting, we become unable to assess them accurately, because any of the good reporting they may be responsible for will have gone wholly ignored. This builds a self-delusion from bias. 

We have to protect against this, and unless we are, we can't have any certainty that our perception of a journalist is fair and accurate. I make a point to do this when I hear *any* media figure say something fair‚Äîeven when I would commonly disagree with this person.

> the credibility of Colbert and the rest of the swamp propagandists is what I was alluding to.

If a journalist's credibility is low, but he reports something accurately, then his credibility necessarily improves. Said journalist should be recognized both for good, when reporting well, and for ill, when reporting poorly.

So if I only ever take note when ""the MSM"" misbehaves, then I will gradually build the worst possible interpretation of ""the MSM,"" and I will have established no check or balance to ensure that the degree of poor journalism which I attribute to ""the MSM"" is commensurate to the poor journalism they actually practice. Then the only way I can be certain of my own view is by literal ignorance and delusion.

I haven't argued that ""the MSM"" does not circulate propaganda. There is no sense trying to prove to me that the MSM does. Of course they do. Both conservative and liberal propaganda flies around like shit in a monkey pen.

>And of course other foreign leaders know a lot from how a leader is governing his own govt. and country.

I never said ""just"". That is something you assumed.

It's one of the inputs to a leader's knowledge, among many other things they know about that leader, either via personal research/opinion/agencies or whatever sources. How a leader is governing certainly says a lot about that leader (and therefore is a source of knowledge), but it would be a little stupid to assume that one would form an opinion just based on that, that too a leader of a country!

So you disagree with this? How a leader is governing does not reflect on his capability/skills/talent/competency as a leader, and therefore does not say a lot about that leader?

>  It was only later on that people started realising what a monster he was, and how erroneous they were to judge him on how he governed.

By this example, are you trying to arrive at a conclusion that how a leader governs does not say anything about that leader?

I don't know which leader praised Hitler and which leader did not, so I cannot comment on that, or assume that you are correct. But you say ""a lot of other leaders"", which leaves space for some leaders who arrived at a different conclusion than the others? Perhaps they thought how Hitler was governing wasn't good?
