gw2e8xt,"For some comments who are asking why people are only criticizing Modi and not blaming the public or other entities, here is my take and answer.

If our beloved PM wants his name and image to be on everything being the attention whore (apologies for this word but whore is what goes with attention the best) he is, toting news agencies everywhere he goes, his photo on the  vaccination certificate, the ironical Covid relief fund name and election rallies with ""I have never seen such large crowds"" crowds, then yes, he is the one to be blamed for all this. He and his entire puppy ring of troll ministers like Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Amit Shah, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Yogi Adityanath and God knows how many else.

Just like the blame of a victory or a failure goes to the captain's name the most, the entire blame here rests on the our beloved PM' shoulders. He has to be the face of criticism also. If my boss takes the credit for all the work I do and puts my dick on the line when shit hits the fan, then my boss is the person who should be getting the biggest splash of the shit.

Every person's death certificate should have his photo on it, being the PR freak he is. That will be some nice PR for BJP.

The sadist in me would want him to be publicly hanged in the final edition of Mann Ki Baat but I guess that's not how civilized society works. The best way for the public to reply is boot this person out of power and never elect a fanatic to power again, at least until the BJP is cleansed of its fanaticism and filth.

As for the claim that AAP did not build the oxygen plants in Jan, the responsibility mostly lies with the Centre. While the Delhi government could have tried harder to set up the plants on their own, this was 90% the responsibility of the Centre. Read [this article](https://scroll.in/article/993309/fact-check-did-states-fail-to-use-pm-cares-funds-allocated-by-the-centre-to-build-oxygen-plants) for details.

Sharing a longish excerpt below with the relevant parts. 

Did the Centre allocate funds to states for building oxygen plants?

No, the Centre did not allocate any funds to states for the installation of oxygen plants in district hospitals. A central agency under the Union health ministry was given the charge of commissioning the oxygen plants, which use the Pressure Swing Adsorption technology and are therefore referred to as PSA oxygen plants.

The Central Medical Services Society floated a tender on October 21, 2020, inviting bids for the installation of 150 PSA oxygen plants across 14 states. Twelve plants were added later to the list. The funds were to come entirely from PM-Cares, or the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations fund, which is controlled by the Centre. Here it is important to note that the tender was floated eight months into the pandemic. The Centre wasted eight months to start the process.

Who is responsible for the installation of the oxygen plants?

The Central Medical Services Society, a body under the Union ministry of health, was responsible for evaluating the bids, checking the eligibility of bidders, fixing prices, selecting vendors and ensuring the selected vendors delivered the goods.

The selected vendors were responsible for the installation of the oxygen plants in the district hospitals.

The role of the state governments was limited to ensuring the district hospitals had completed the civil and electrical work required for the plants. The district hospitals had to provide a site readiness certificate to the vendor.",1,2,1619538092.0,linguapura,False,negative,negative,neutral,negative

False, as expected. [Here's a detailed takedown](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/pm-cares-delhi-maharashtra-oxygen-plants-health-covid-19-12937) of this fake news. Sharing an excerpt below... 

PM CARES did not allot money to the states. **In January, PM CARES allotted money - specifically ₹201.58 crores for the installation of 162 dedicated Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen generation plants to the CMSS, a central government body.** The CMSS was responsible for evaluating and selecting vendors, fixing the price, and ensuring the selected vendors delivered the goods. The Press Information Bureau and PMO release outlining this allocation makes no mention of any money been given to the state.

The CMSS released a tender in October 2020 inviting bids for 150 such plants. The hospitals where these plants would be set up were also identified. Delhi was to get eight plants and Maharashtra would get 10. Further, in this tender, the role of the hospital under each state has also been demarcated. They were tasked with managing space, electrical supply, faults, civil repairs, pipeline works, and leakages among other things. It is to be noted that the first tender was released eight months after the Modi government imposed a lockdown to curb the pandemic. **The plants had to be established by the CMSS and was funded directly by the central government.**",1,5,1619636704.0,linguapura,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

If turmeric has evidence for having some anti oxidant benefits, it becomes evidence based medicine even though it was part of Ayurveda. Do you understand now? In the last 50 years, every domain in science expanded exponentially. So yes, I repeat again, not just biology, EVERY domains' knowledge has expanded exponentially in the last 50 years, not just medicine. So thousands of years of experience of not knowing anything about genetics is like thousands of years of mathematics without calculus or computers. You want more proof of this? No one can understand anything important about the human body without first understanding genetics. Genetics only became mainstream about 50 years ago in modern medicine.

gw6edne,"Who told you that it was medicinal science, psychiatry, preventive care... that needed to be studied. Yes you are right, it was ayurveda.

Science is a body of validated knowledge. But what about wisdom ? Does science say anything about wisdom ? Do you think wisdom is important ? Does science tell you if you should apply knowledge or not. No it doesn't. Whatever does answer this question is not science, it's something other than science.

I am not saying that Ayurveda is analogous to science, I am saying it's broader than science in its scope. It deals with stuff that science by definition doesn't deal with.

Most questions that we deal with in our day to day lives will illustrate the limitations of science.  Let's take a simple example, what is living /non-living? One may say, that which breathes is living - what about organisms that don't have lungs. That whose heart beats is living - what about them whose heart stops but are revived by defibrillator. One that eats - what about black holes that eat other black holes. One that can reproduce - what about a computer virus that can replicate itself... And so on. 

Our medical definition of human death has been changing throughout the last century and that's because the goal is to find a state from where a person can not be revived. And who came up with that goal ? Not science.  Science still doesn't even  know if a virus is living or not...",1,2,1619621237.0,ansh5441,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

the *prophylactic* use of antibiotics

the many *prophylactic* measures that city officials could have taken to reduce the scope of the disaster
