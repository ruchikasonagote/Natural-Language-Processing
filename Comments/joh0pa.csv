Although these provisions of the law are there through which cases can be filed against the police, there are also, at the same time, various immunities they enjoy by virtue of several laws. One such provision is Section 132 of Criminal Procedure Code 1973 which bars the filing of a criminal case against police officers in certain circumstances. Similarly, under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code, a person requires permission of the Central Government for instituting criminal proceedings against a police officer who is accused of committing a crime while on duty.

In addition to these provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code, there are also state-specific laws, since law and order is a state subject and high court rules which require special procedures to file cases against the Police officials.",6,4,1604590909.0,gaurangpanchal94,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral
