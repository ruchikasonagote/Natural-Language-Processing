gw60mv7,"So his first argument is:

""Multiple people were texting the same set of sentences, and it was people from outside India making these tweets"". 

Two questions:

0. Let us indeed assume that your premise is true - I mean in a country of a billion people with almost entity of the country going through the SAME crisis (lack of oxygen, medicines, supplies and irresponsible political parties conducting rallies in the middle of the pandemic), I think it's plausible that multiple people might end up tweeting the same thing. There are hundreds of millions of active Twitter users from India. Anyways, let's assume you are correct in assuming the text was indeed copy pasted by multiple different people.

1. Have you ever been part of a fucking social media campaign or protest? When students in my university protested against the administration for their tone deaf stance to student mental health, and increasing tuition fees last year, we setup a tweet campaign as well. One of the FIRST things we did there was to maintain a shared Google Doc with a set of potential tweets that people could copy and share, along with a consistent set of hashtags to use. One person tweeting alone does nothing - the whole point of a social media campaign is coordinated fucking action. 

2. This now leads us to two important questions: (1) was the content of these tweets objectively false? No. (2) were they inviting violence? No. So if multiple Indians share the SAME tweet which is not fake news and which is not inviting violence WHAT DID THEY WRONG?

gw62pih,"You didn't misunderstand. This is sadly the viewpoint of the Indian government today. And to some extent, this is how our governments always have been. People appeal cases like these all the way to the supreme court, and the supreme court does end up overruling the government and rebuking it for violating Article 19 (freedom of speech) of our Constitution... but by the time justice is served, it's often months later and the temporary bans have already done their job successfully. 

Like, over the last one year, these are the reasons and justifications I've heard from spokespersons of the government for clamping down on social media:

1. Fake news (even when it's not)
2. ""Offending the sensibilities of religion X"" - almost any minor criticism (even legitimate) of religious practices (be it Muslim or Hindu) is often met with hostility.
3. ""Inciting violence"" - at this point, even someone saying ""we should flood the streets of Delhi and protest"" would end up getting booked under our IT act for 'inciting violence'. Whether or not they get convicted aside, the very fact that you can initially get arrested is a huge chilling effect on free speech. 

One incident that really stands out is the case of Disha Ravi - farmers in India were protesting a new law, and as a part of the protest Disha, along with a couple others were making a shared Google Doc with common talking points, template tweets and hashtags users could share and some press releases. The government of India arrested her on charges of sedition because 'the toolkit was used by foreign actors to influence domestic agenda to incite violence'. Who were these foreign actors? Celebrities like Greta Thunberg and Rihanna. 

At this point... I kinda feel sad about how ""anti-nationalist"" is commonly thrown around as a term for anyone who criticises the government. Maybe I'm going the other extreme, but the only day I'll accept India is really free... is the day someone could burn an Indian flag in New Delhi and not be charged (legally) as a criminal for burning it (unless they violate fire codes or their burning it harms other people there or if they do it with an illegal accelerant).

Extreme, I know. But the whole ""you're antinational and you can be arrested if you do X"" is a very slippery slope. We started out there - people who burn flags, support enemy states like Pakistan should be jailed. And slowly, we've devolved to this.

It hides the government's incompetence on a gross scale and will be silenced when it gains concessions from the government. The papers are the ones who decide who get elected. It hides under the disguise of Free speech. The saddest thing is I am a big believer of free media, minimal government interference etc. But this is a mutation of the media having too much power due people like Viscount Rothermere and the Murdoch Family.

(A) Focusing on giving everyone the first vaccine is more effective than focusing on giving everyone two. Your theory that the UK's strategy will backfire is groundless. 

(B) In order for the EU to overtake the UK, it needs to process far more vaccinations per day relative to population, because the UK has a considerably lead. But the UK is still processing more vaccinations per day (relative to population) than almost any EU country. In other words, the UK's lead is still growing.
