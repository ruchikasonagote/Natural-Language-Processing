gx5bsi5,"Congrats on your grandma recovering OP! I lost 2 uncle's who were in their 60s and in very good physical shape (x military). Here's my half Indian, half american perspective on the virus:

I am sad to see the poor die as they are effected the most. I had been having conversations with the India side of my family since March of 2020 and I was told off as being ignorant, naive. Us indians have better immune systems as Americans. Basically none of the covid restrictions were being implemented and they were damn proud of it. 

Now in the wave, I lost both my dear uncle's and I cry cause they were like dad's to me. But at the same time I get angry. Don't they deserve this? For not taking any precautions? Heck even after my uncle's death, his daughter is having the maids come n clean without vaccinations or any social distancing restrictions. There's 2 kids in the house too btw. I just have to sympathy or empathy for them left. 

I know I am a horrible person for saying this but India brought this on their own self and now begging in the international community for help. I am ashamed to be an Indian. This is so typical. Sorry for the rant. Y'all can hate on me now.",8,0,1620307666.0,,False,positive,neutral,negative,neutral
