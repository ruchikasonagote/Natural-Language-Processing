However, considering your later statement, I can tell you that this is a primitive approach. During total solar eclipse, what we are experiencing is Annular, moon obstructs the path of Sun from earth completely effectively darkening earth during midday. During this time animals and birds freak out as they are confused by the unplanned darkness. I feel us keeping our food in dark and taking a shower is similar to their response. 


Sun also emits UV radiation, which kills bacteria. So we need to look into UV radiation experienced on earth at the time of eclipse. If we see a drop in UV, does it have any effect on food if exposed? It’ll be a hard to prove the correlation between that.
