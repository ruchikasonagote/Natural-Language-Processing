Please answer this :-
In a country with a population of 1.3 billion people, only dwarfed by China who we know next to nothing about in terms of actual casualties due to Covid, what empirical data are you drawing to compare the performance of the Pandemic management & then using it to bash the name of your own country ?

How many times since India's independence has a Pandemic of this scale hit before & how did the government manage it the last time ?

As per news, India is in talks with countries like USA, France, China, Saudi Arabia and others who are sending medical aid as I write this. Are you aware of all this ?

I'll join you & bash the government in that they have been abysmal to say the least. What are we doing to help as a fellow Indians ?

It's easy to flow down in the feeling of pain & despair. Easier still to condemn on social media.

This is the 2nd wave which is common in a Pandemic. This situation is being faced by other countries too right now with much smaller population, more resources & they're still finding it extremely difficult to manage it despite best efforts & strict rules.

[Modi govt says there’s no vaccine shortage, but states & hospitals tell a different story.

The Modi govt said that there was no vaccine shortage on April 8th. 

[The Centre had last November announced a Rs 900-crore project, coordinated by the Union science ministry’s department of biotechnology, for Covid-19 vaccines.But none of this money went to either Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India at Pune, or Covaxin, the home-grown vaccine made by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech. Instead, a part of it was given to candidate vaccines that were at more nascent stages of development.An epidemiologist who asked not to be named described this as a “botch-up”.The Serum Institute invested $270 million (Rs 2,012 crore) of its money and $300 million (Rs 2,236 crore) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to build production capacity for its vaccines, while Bharat Biotech relied almost entirely on its internal resources.](https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/how-we-landed-in-covid-vaccine-mess/cid/1812969) 

The Central Govt only announced to vaccinate the >18yr old after Manmohan Singh sent a letter advising them to do it. Before the letter the GOI was busy with 'need vs want' arguments on vaccine distribution. 

The vaccine has little to do with the current shitshow, Biden/US didn't ask Modi to conduct Kumbh Mela or election rallies, Biden/US didn't stop Modi from investing in more oxygen plants, Biden/US didn't cover Modi's ears when experts warned India about the imminent second wave. The lack of preparedness is on Modi.

I wish I can say I'm keeping up with world news, or even what's happening in my own country, but after 2020 and the last election my brain is fried and my focus is mainly on keeping myself and my family safe from this virus. We're incredibly lucky to be in an area that has had a huge rollout of vaccines, in fact, my sister is a nurse administering at about 100 a day.  But numbers are still increasing hear. Instead of taking drastic action, it feels like they're trying to create a sense of safety and normality. Five weeks. Five weeks of another shutdown with people properly compensated and social distancing strictly enforced as they put all attention on vaccinations. That would drop the numbers drastically and prevent them from climbing.

But the attention is elsewhere, and far too many people have just accepted this as the new normal. Trump and his constant threats of doing something wildly stupid - and inspiring about 100million to do things as stupid - are gone, but we're still stuck with people that are putting companies before people because those companies line their pockets. It's the same companies owned by the richest people in the world but don't care whatsoever about the safety or pay of their employees that actually do all the manpower that lets the company function.

After this shitshow, we’ll go back to normal, where it’ll be touted again that we have defeated everything thanks to a certain someone. The day India stops appointing incompetent egomaniacs to positions of power is the day I will believe we as a country have done something right. The very few media outlets asking questions are constantly berated by idiots who don’t understand how a democracy works-they ask questions and are supposed to be sceptical you stupid idiots. They shouldn’t be supportive of every stupid little thing the government does, they are allowed to be critical. 

When we were relatively unscathed in the 1st wave, some people were quick to say the Central Govt did well, but now there’s chaos everywhere, suddenly it’s the State Govts that have fucked up. That’s not how this works you stupid fucks. If you gave credit to the Center for the handling the first time, it has to be the same center that has to answer questions now. 
“It’s not the time for politics” they say, I would have agreed with that but you know what?? Someone has his face on vaccine certificates. It is always about politics for a certain party, why stop now?? 

The stories I’ve heard from my friends and colleagues working in the worst affected areas has absolutely killed me on the inside.

Edit: They didn’t stop there. They mocked the people who predicted this might happen the first time. You know why it didn’t happen?? Because people had to sit in their homes for 3months, not because they were doomsayers. There was no way India could handle 300,000 cases per day. Estimating 10% of the cases need admissions in the hospital, thats 30,000 cases per day who need monitoring, O2, Ventilators etc.

Let me say this again, your regressive ideology is an illness plaguing the collective,So while you make this baseless claim of healthcare being ""ignored"" in the past, while simultaneously conceding that it is what is happening today, you denounce the obvious incremental advancements of modern medical science as a collective endeavour of the minority of rational humans over decades in a country fraught and over-encumbered by superstition and dogma for centuries. Even today, this micro minority is being forced to fight a losing battle against the pandemic. It is them on the front lines fighting and dying to to save even the undeserving like you. And yet here you are somehow trying to distract from the criminal negligence of those you chose to lead, and the fatal consequences currently playing out.  You are the true sickness in our country. You, who would hide behind this absurd claim of racism for being shown the effects of your collective ignorance in defence of a sectarian agenda in the middle of a pandemic that makes no such distinction, you have chosen to be a part of the problem and not the solution. In this you are not unique, for even this ideology you imported from German fascists. You dare accuse me of being the cancer?

gvolblf,"Lol, he didn't even wear a mask until 100k Americans died. They tried to buy the rights exclusively for them from a German company. This is my favorite comment about that. If that doesn't piss you off, Trump's entire COVID-19 response wasn't just catastrophic. It was a literal racketeering scam.

Hospitals say feds are seizing masks and other coronavirus supplies without a word. (1)

This is in addition to the feds stealing supplies from shipments from states, and acts of piracy abroad. (2)

Here's how what they're doing works:

1.) Eliminate oversight of the spending of nearly a trillion dollars of tax dollars. (3)

2.) Acquire the authority to command which businesses get which contracts. (4)

3.) Have trusted people stand up companies through which the money can be funneled (3 week old company, founded through a loan approved via the Coronavirus Stimulus bill, is now the center of medical supply distribution): (5) “I don’t want to overstate, but we probably represent the largest global supply chain for Covid-19 supplies right now,” he said. “We are getting ready to fill 100 million-unit mask orders.” (16)

4.) Have the federal government sell, at a reduced price, its strategic stockpile to the new companies, run by your buddies. (6) (15)

5.) Have the states bid on the supplies, driving up the price. (7)

6.) Have the federal government spend taxpayer dollars to ship supplies purchased from China to these brand new private companies. (8)

7.) Eliminate the competition. Attack any company that doesn’t play ball. (9)

────────

States are having to smuggle in supplies (17) aboard sports teams jets (among other methods), and escort them with state police (10). Is it really to this point that we're going to have to have states deploy the national guard to protect their shipments and supplies and treat the federal government like the enemy?

This is no different from the Somalian government stealing food sent by the United Nations and cartels selling it illegally. (11)

Except in this situation FEMA is the cartels and the banana republic is the United States.

Also regarding Trump removing the watchdog overseeing the $2 trillion coronavirus bill? In 1998 the Supreme Court ruled line item vetos are unconstitutional. (12)

His excuse? The Take Care Clause. And the Take Care Clause just says the President can't make his underlings do stuff that's against the law. It underscores that the executive is under a duty to faithfully execute the laws of Congress and not disregard them. (13)

If you don't know what that's about, Trump wrote a signing statement (basically functionally a line item veto except the next President could undo it, but by then it'd be too late) into the stimulus bill that he was going to ignore the oversight provisions in the bill and do it himself. (14) Either way, the Take Care Clause makes it illegal. 

According to Bradley and Posner, since the president is actually obligated under the “Take Care Clause” to comply with the constitution, “if the president believes that a statute violates the constitution, he has a constitutional obligation not to enforce it” (Bradley and Posner: 358).(16) The opposite also holds true (see citation 13).

Worse? They specifically knew it would hit Democratic cities and population centers hard and they wanted it to. That's genocide, according to Mirriam-Webster - though undoubtedly a crime against humanity according to international law. (18)(19)

Of course that's in addition to the genocide (even by International Law) he's committing against the immigrant detainees that are in ICE concentration camps with forced sterilization of women. (20) Mass hysterectomies. That's in addition to purposefully using industrial disinfectant that causes chemical burns and bleeding. (21) And sexually assaulting detainees. (22) And letting COVID-19 run rampant through detention centers and not actually performing healthcare, falsifying records, and worse. (23)

She may have had a jab, but she has not been vaccinated and her lack of fear would be unjustified if she had, because the jab doesn't offer any protection against so called covid.
My 'deranged ramblings' as you call them are based in truth unlike your insults.

I have a few points to make.

Firstly, India is in the top 3 countries that have jabbed the most people. Percentages have nothing to do with it.
China, USA and India have the highest figures. We are seeing massive numbers of terrible side effects after people get the jab in all countries. From the USA we see many many first hand reports of this. From China, well, nobody knows what is happening in China lol.. but if people were experiencing adverse side effects in China I wouldn't expect to hear about it as they China never want to seem weak.
In the UK we have the same situation.

Secondly, there actually some doubt over whether the jabbed figures are true because if they lied about covid case figures over the last year then why should we trust them now when there is so much hesitence from people (at least in the western world) to line up for the jab.

Thirdly, how do you know she has had a jab? I'll admit I don't know either way. I've seen video proof that many celebrities have NOT received a real injection but rather they use a fake syringe with a retractable needle. 
Friend, they are lying about everything. 
It is very sad that so many people have died, but the reason for it is very very likely not to be what the media or the government is claiming.

Think about it, if they blamed these recent deaths on adverse reactions from the jab, then the last wouldn't be good for business now would it.",1,4,1619337353.0,FishManc,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral

Bullshit. Please get a nurse and doctor to corroborate your claim. You cannot substitute poor imagination for reality no matter how much you want to.

This is why your opinion matters the least. You don't have to deal with trying to save lives line a nurse or doctor and failing. For hours everyday. 10-12 deaths everyday. You are not on the front line.

Mamta had rallies, Rahul’s congress had rallies in WB.  Kumbh mela was allowed.

Kejriwal will blame centre for not getting enough oxygen. 
Why cant you see that Kejriwal failed to manage this pandemic 
He had recently made an announcement where 50% of the beds were allotted for covid. Why not more if the situation is so bad ?
Although most of the cases in India are coming for selected dozen states. 
When the situation in other states is fine, the CM is appreciated for good management. When situation is bad in these dozen states, the centre is blamed ?

This is because EU and other countries have opened their markets to these vaccines. We didn't. Because Modi wanted to spread the make in India propaganda instead of investing everything to get our large population vaccinated ad quickly as possible.

> and elections only is wrong

repeat: are you fucking kidding me? not highlighting elections in the 2nd most populated country in the world as a danger during the pandemic? getting the EC to have unprecedented *eight-stage* elections during a pandemic? This wasn't a danger? 

> Not just centre but state govt has failed too miserably in anticipating what is coming. 

Why blame the goddamn states when the Centre took all the powers with the Disaster Management Act and stated **in September** that India was [""more than adequately prepared for a Coronavirus surge""?](https://www.article-14.com/post/india-more-than-adequately-prepared-for-covid-surge-health-minister)

The central government controls vaccines AND oxygen and if it was managed well they would waste no time in taking credit for it. And in  your reply, you repeatedly join ""state governments"" with central government. 

* Who in the world controlled the vaccine? The Centre. 
* Who delayed the decision to place orders for vaccines until months after the US and Europe had placed massive orders for far smaller populations? The Centre. 
* Who allowed Bharat Biotech to proceed without getting full clearance but denied Sputnik, Moderna and Janssen for not clearing the same hurdles? The Centre. 
* Who exported millions of doses and completely missed the chance that the surge would happen? The Centre. 
* Who first withheld doses from those who wanted them *even as tens of thousands were being wasted* ? The Centre. 
* Who prevented states, hospitals and people from IMPORTING vaccines at market prices? The fucking Centre and it's fetish for centralising every goddamn thing to two people.

This fucking hell that we're in - forget euphemism like ""centre"" or ""System"" - Modi is quick to take *personal* fucking credit for every single good thing that happens whether or not past governments had any role to play in them or not - Mangalyaan to Bangalore Metro.

Does that not make you emotional, my friend?

But when we have no vaccines, no oxygen,no beds, no medicines all we have is each other and HOPE. Hope that this too shall pass and when the time comes we will unite to dethrone India's executioner and his little cronies. Like Leonard Cohen said, ""there's a crack in everything.

Exactly my point man. We're a population of 150 crore people. Our governments should have been more smarter. If there was a threat of a 2nd wave, they should have known we'd be completely fucked over. I'll also dissect the rest of your argument. 

>It takes time to build infrastructure within short span to come up with research facility and start developing vaccine. 

Except that the Serum Institute of India is the world's largest vaccine manufacturer. Except that we've always had a great vaccination strategy in place and are the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer.

[India's Vaccine Colossus Is A Model For The World To Follow - WSJ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/indias-vaccine-colossus-is-a-model-for-the-world-to-follow-11609930891)

We've had run vaccination programmes in the past before, which is why were able to completely eradicate Polio, and if I recall, eveb ahead of the set deadlines. So to say that we didn't have the resources or strategy is just an excuse for our government's incompetence. We all know that their priority were the elections. Not only BJP's, but every other party. All are in the same boat. 

>Many foreign vaccines require special kind of storage facility which could not be feasible for tropical country like India where it could be an issue

If that were the case, how were WE able to send vaccines outside? Vaccines *anywhere* require low temperatures - doesn't matter the climate. Here, this site mentions the storage temperatures of all the vaccines -

[Storage Temperatures of All Vaccines - BBC](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55748124.amp)

So, as you can see, this was not a challenge never seen before. In fact we've had infrastructure for such emergency responses since a long time. The government has now green-lighted other vaccines in India. Why now? Why not before? After all, we're a population of 150 crore people. Anyone could have imagined what would have happened if a more infectious strain was found in India. And now we're literally seeing all of it unravel before our eyes. And seriously, our population is so huge that there are chances the virus will mutate even more here, and can render previous vaccines ineffective. Anyone with a this much would have realized that there's only one thing we can do - vaccinate like crazy. We had the resources, we had the infrastructure, and we still couldn't. There's incompetence right there for you.

My father is a doctor and his words ring in my ears everyday. He said a year back, when the pandemic was just about to begin and we saw a situation similar to the one we're seeing right now, but only less severe - he said that the governments are so incompetent that if a 2nd wave came in our country we'll be finished. There's no way we'd be able to contain the virus in such a huge population. And that's exactly what is happening right now. All of this could have been avoided. People could have been vaccinated in much larger numbers from the start. And how much can you blame people for being complacent, really, when our political leaders are busy conducting rallies and melas. The priority was never the pandemic.

> The reason why tablighi got the attention is not primarily because of the gathering but what their ppl did afterwards. They spitting and misbehaving with the COVID frontline workers is the main reason they got highlighted.

Absolutely not. They got attention [because of the role they are alleged to have played in spreading the virus.](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/the-big-story/story/20200420-the-taint-of-corona-1665529-2020-04-11) 

What do you think will happen if you send the cops at the super spreader sadhus and try and jail them when they are trying to perform a religious ritual? Do you think they'll put down the trishuls and not one will misbehave?. Don't compare apples and oranges. And absolutely rw twitter and the Godi media demonised an entire religion for it, don't you forget it. 

> I never said keeping the Kumbh mela in 2021 was the wise idea. It’s the people’s health and welfare which is primary and any such gathering must have been avoided. But yes, If those fucking Muslim terrorist organisations has any idea, they would know the damage would be equal to Muslims as well because the virus don’t pick and choose based on the religion

The whole point which you seem to have missed was that not even the nation's worst enemy could have come up with a better plan of killing Indians than the government did which allowed a Kumbh Mela, held cricket matches in the Narendra Modi Stadium... AND elections during a pandemic. 

> But you failed to comment how a state thousands of km away from both the kumbh and Bengal elections that you so strongly highlighted is facing the worst wave second time in the row. Don’t you have any “fucking” comment about it.

I'm not an epidemiologist and it could be any number of things - could be that the new variant spread massively in Nagpur and Pune, which were the main hubs even in early March. It could be that there was insufficient emphasis given on mask wearing in Maharashtra while there was still time. But allowing people to congregate at the Kumbh and spread disease to every corner of the country was the most godawful decision of the government. Times of India reported that [11% of the people on a train carrying pilgrims returning from the Kumbh tested positive in Ahmedabad](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gujarat-34-passengers-from-haridwar-test-covid-19-positive-at-ahmedabad/articleshow/82120932.cms). And you now see the prasad they have spread across the country. Delhi began to be hit and continues to bear the brunt because every sick person in Haridwar who can will come to Delhi in an emergency.
