hdfww8h,"Be thankful that the situation isn't worse than this. 

Russian packaged food products are much worse than Indian ones when it comes to this type of practice. The packet says it's a Russian chocolate. You bite into it and there's literally just a 0.5 mm thick layer of chocolate on the outside and the inside is just filler. 

It's either a milk/caramel/nougat filler or sometimes a thick jelly-like filling that is grape or some other fruit flavored. You bring them home on a hot day and the outer chocolate shell is so thin that a 3rd of it just stuck to the wrapper. 

From the cross section, American chocolates seem like they're much better and purer than Indian or Russian ones. But having consumed tons of them, I can say with authority that they're just as bad. What Americans do is they dissolve the Cocoa itself with so much high fructose corn syrup (cheaper substitute to cane sugar, less flavorful) and other additives such that what you are eating tastes very little like chocolate, especially if you take out the fillers such as nuts, raisins and peanut butter. In fact, they can't call them chocolate when they export to Europe, they have to use the term chocolate candy. 

As a kid I used to look at our 5 star and be disappointed at how much of the chocolate is caramel, i.e. just processed sugar. But 5 star is proper luxury compared to Russian chocolates. And the bigger Cadbury bars that come in cardboard packaging these days are miles ahead of the equivalent Hershey bars when it comes to taste. 

Unfortunately, I come from an age where 20 rupees was sufficient for a good Cadbury bar and 5 star used to actually cost 5 rupees. That 90s Indian in me simply cannot tolerate paying Rs. 100+ for a bar of chocolate. That type of money used to be my total collections from grandparents on Holi/Diwali during some years. So I just tell myself that eating healthy is important and not buy any chocolate while I wait in the shadows for someone else to buy them so that I can lagao *nazar* on their chocolate and get a quarter of it for free.",8,0,1632041306.0,og_m4,False,negative,neutral,negative,negative

Also there are two very obviously wrong claims made on this post (1) that the promotion is for 20% extra instead of 20gm extra and (2) that the gaps are increased to make the package look bigger as opposed to providing structural integrity/preventing breakage.
