Well, last year I went to my friend‚Äôs catholic wedding...

Back story- My mom was catholic, and we intermittently went to different types of Christian churches throughout my childhood.  Even in college and right after, I tried to go to church a couple times because I was doing drugs and drinking too much, so my life was chaotic, and I figured I could use a little help from upstairs.

ANYWAY, back to this wedding.  So I‚Äôm a quasi-wanna-be-religious person.  I go up during communion and I think, ‚ÄúI want to eat this fuckin cracker‚Äù. 

Apparently you‚Äôre supposed to say something when they hand you the body of Christ, because this priest looks me straight in the eye and says ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not catholic, are you?‚Äù  Like I literally have the horns of Lucifer sticking out of my forehead.

I say ‚Äúuh uh no‚Äù and then he shakes his head at me, and aggressively starts blessing all the wine and crackers again.  I walk away.  SO MORTIFIED because, once again, I‚Äôm at my friend‚Äôs wedding, so I know a bunch of people there.  Most of which, just crossed their hands over their chest and skipped communion.

So after a couple days, I realize how angry I was about the whole ordeal.  The way the priest looked at and acted towards me was like I literally confessed to being a pedo.  (Oh, wait, that‚Äôs them).

Lord Krishna supports action, rather than grief or depression, as a means of coping with a stressful situation. Multiple slokas of the Gita reinforce this message, which is equally relevant for persons with diabetes.

‚Äú ‚Ä¶*nor let your attachment be to inaction*‚Äù

Lord Krishna promotes both the paths of knowledge and action but clearly supports action. This is true in health as well. While we should equip ourselves with knowledge and information about our illness, we should not limit ourselves to this. It is more fruitful to take tangible action to fight disease. This may be in the form of investigations, nonpharmacological therapy, drug treatment, or other modalities such as surgery.

## 2. Social distancing and isolation

**He said, ‚ÄúDo not place a sick patient with a healthy person.‚Äù This teaching was extended to animals as well; ‚ÄúThe cattle suffering from a disease should not be mixed with healthy cattle.‚Äù (*****Sahih al-Bukhari*****)**

&#x200B;

3. Hygiene

**Furthermore, when he would sneeze, the Holy Prophet¬†would cover his face and muffle the sneeze, effectively containing the spread of airborne bacteria and viruses. (*****Jami‚Äò al-Tirmidhi*****)**

## 4. Seeking medical treatment

**He replied, ‚ÄúSeek (medical) treatment, O Slaves of Allah, for Allah does not create any disease but He also creates with it the cure, except for old age.‚Äù (*****Sunan Ibn Majah*****)**

gx143xi,"From my personal experience and from what I have seen after interacting with a lot of students, the huge majority of people who go outside, in foreign countries, to study or for a job, do so because the system here has failed them. I have numerous examples when a student couldn't crack JEE because it was absurdly tough or couldn't get a job because his GPA was too low - US and other countries almost look like a second chance. Their market is still driven by talent over grades. For example, I know someone who did Btech from a not-so-good college, didn't get a job, so did masters. Didn't get a job even then, because he never was interested in computer science. Stayed unemployed for 1-2 years and then finally something burned in him and he went for PhD in US in a reputed university. He has now completed his degree well before the stipulated tenure and has published research papers multiple international journals. This person would have beem deemed a failure here, both academically and socially. But the US didn't. So here our system failed.

Secondly, many intelligent people also go abroad because they think there are no challenging opportunities here. If you're not in IT, chances are you can almost always have better opportunities abroad than here because we don't manufacture anything (compared to the number of people ofc) and the number of Indian companies are too low. Even in IT, we don't have much IPR compared to other countries so what incentive do truly intelligent people have of being here? Again, our system failed. 

Thirdly, many students think it's easy to get a job or stay abroad. You'd be surprised how many of them return or want to return back to India. Again, I know someone who did his Bachelors from IITD in CS, went to UCLA, one of the top universities and returned back in 10 years and would have done so much earlier, if he didn't have the student loan. Many students want to return, but they can't because they're stuck in the H1B system over there. If you're not from the top of the top university, your chances of getting hired as an international student are really low. And if you're on H1B, it becomes increasingly difficult to change jobs too, not to mention that a person on H1B gets significantly less than their American counterparts. Ofcourse this example is based on US immigration system, but Europe is not different too. Here, their immigration system has failed. If it makes getting a green card getting easier or immigration easier, then you can be sure that many people would want to return to India, because the difference in culture is too much for them to handle. Many Indians don't adapt to foreign culture. 

So with this complete picture you can see that there are fundamental problems that lead to the so-called brain drain. We should do what the Japanese did - sent their students to study in top US universities and then assimilated them back into the Japanese society easily so that they can build things there. And now Japan, such a tiny country, has the world's 3rd largest GDP. We don't do that here. We have to be open to students who study abroad and give them more incentive to come here, with higher pay or better positions, and you know that they will. This will also force our universities and education system to wake the fuck up. I really like the NEP, cuz it fundamentally changes the education system. But this government also promised manufacturing boom - 'Make in India' - and didn't do shit about it. So I don't have much hopes of NEP too. Unless we strengthen these two things - we'll continue to see brain drain. And if the foreign countries made their immigration easier, we can see even more. Like in Canada - it has become our students' favorite foreign country to study because of its point- based immigration system.",7,5,1620225396.0,POI_Mr_Singh,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

So good job on that part. I wish people who are religious are more like you.

Now about the resources shared: It seems to me that whatever was written in these scriptures is very generic sometimes. Whatever Lord Krishna said to Arjuna about action and knowledge, you've extrapolated it to fit a narrative here. It's a good narrative, ultimately will help this pandemic in a big way if people follow it. But a narrative nonetheless.

Similarly about what prophet Muhammed said, very sensible things. But why do we need someones words from a bygone era to tackle a pandemic from a virus that probably didn't even exist when it was written. The thing about hygiene and isolation of a diseased person or town doesn't required knowledge from a holy spirit. It's a knowledge acquired after hundreds of years of observation and documentation from various medical professionals across the world, which as per me carries more weight compared to that of teachings from people who we aren't even sure if they existed.

In the end, I don't mind people following religion as long as they do it in a non violent form without interfering the lives of others, even if it's people of their own religion.

gx1x7tv,"Yes brother. The answer for your question that why people don't believe or follow according to facts given by Medical Professionals or Science is because people or humans are dumb, Indisciplined, and filled with many other evils like Envy, Ego, Jealously etc since many centuries. When we read our History of our World and Human History, we can find many instances /times when the people were Indisciplined, used to do drugs, Doing Adultery, Prostitution, Robbery, Burning the women in the Name of Witch-Hunting etc. and other crimes that we cannot imagine. And in India you could find people used to follow many superstitions including Sati Sahagamana, Kanyasulk etc.

&#x200B;

In Hinduism and as per Hindu Scriptures Different Gods have taken form on Earth during different Times of World to save the World from these evils of Society. To make Human Pure from these bad practices.

In Islam also God has chosen Prophet Muhammad as a messenger to pass the Message of God to the society so that a proper Discipline, Stable Society free from Corruption, Prostitution, Ignorance and other evils of society could be instated.

In Christianity, Jesus Christ has been chosen by God for the same reasons.

So, as per the above analysis we can say that Religions have been established firmly since many centuries due to their practices which have put humans in a Right Path with disciplined society.

So, Utimately We have been made to believe in God and to fear God more than Normal Humans in the form of punishment in Hell. As per Human Psychology, Humans believe more in God than Science. ***This is where the problem starts...***

Most of the people especially in India, People are too weak to external influences wrt Religion. Many people in general do not and have not learnt their religious scriptures properly and the word of Religious leader has become more prominent than the Scriptures themselves. For Example, ""This Covid Situation"" - This is a perfect example of Ignorance of people. \[Cuz people believe more in God \[*Edit : God made by Religious leader*\] than in Science - and those Religious leaders are making profit out of it\]

If the people start to understand their scriptures properly then this situation would never have occurred.

So, for the prevailing situation in India, the Religious leaders are not only the responsible for it but also the Ignorant people and dumbfucks and ofcourse politicians.

Finally I would conclude by saying that Religion is not against the Science and infact a proper religious person would never go to Temples, Mosques and other religious places and Religion is the only tool which prevents humans from doing bad deeds by frightening them with KARMA and DAY OF JUDGEMENT.

Due to these limitations such propositions will always be a theory. One thing to note is these propositions are based on repeatable evidences.

Coming to the existence God. There is no repeatable evidence of the existence of God. These were fictitious characters created by our ancestors to have a one stop answer to the questions that were unknown, for eg:-
Why does it rain?
Why do people die? 
Why are there diseases?

i am not arguing in favour of God here. I am
only pointing out that just because a God let people suffer doesn‚Äôt actually mean he doesn‚Äôt exist, which was what OP said. I reasoned that his reasoning doesn‚Äôt negate God at all. 

But let‚Äôs address some of the points you made. 

We don‚Äôt know exactly how the universe started. Solving that has always been a scientific goal. The Big Bang sadly doesn‚Äôt answer that completely because it begs the question what caused the big bang? Also, the big bang isn‚Äôt an universally accepted theory. We just have to accept that for now we don‚Äôt know what caused the universe. Which is okay scientifically speaking. 

As for living beings, while i agree there is no need
to involve God to explain that as it properly did happen within the natural laws of the universe, i would note that even the origin of life isn‚Äôt completely understood. We don‚Äôt yet know what led to the creation of single cell organism. Everything after that is pretty much explained with natural selection and evolution. But we don‚Äôt know what led to single cell organisms. If it was a random mixing of carbon atoms then why hasn‚Äôt that happened many times? why did life only originated on earth once?

Some people have proposed that maybe life didn‚Äôt origin on earth at all, and that‚Äôs why there is only single tree of life, a theory known as perspermia .
