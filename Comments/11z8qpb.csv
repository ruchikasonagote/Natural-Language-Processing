See people talking about abusing them bts, in chains, carrying sticks. But you also see their trunk holding the sticks as a way of holding hands to follow them. They aren't always on chains as you see them going to forests and rivers. If not in chain to hold what would you want to tie them. Also you can't look at them 24/7. Even in home you tie your pets with chains or in cage.

These so called saints in the documentary were carrying sticks which is used to hit these poor elephants. Keep in mind the elephants shown in the documentary are not adults yet. Makers of the documentary definitely have footage of the abuse but carefully edited them out otherwise international audience wouldn’t appreciate it.
