i0f38ny,"I can go into more details if u want. The reason pakistan has no choice but to show restraint is that it simply cannot afford to fight india right now. Many reasons for it.

1. India simply has superior missiles. Brahmos puts indian missiles a tier above pakistan air defense systems. This means that if pakistan makes the mistake of retaliating with a missile then it would have to stare down a barrage of brahmos missiles which it can do nothing about. India has better air defense systems which pakistani missiles cannot break through right now.

2. Simple terrain. Did u notice how russia is able to simply move its tanks upto Kiev? Thats because Kiev lacks natural borders. Same is the case with Islamabad. Indian missile silos have Islamabad at range  meaning many brahmos missiles can be fired directly at the capital and indian tanks can storm Islamabad since Islamabad lacks natural cover.

3. Pakistan lacks any strong port presence... indian navy can isolate pakistan by just blocking off ONE port.

Reallifelore did a video about it. ""Why pakistans Geography sucks"", please watch it.

Basically, pakistan is forced to show restraint. Even if the test killed a few people pakistan would have still shown restraint... what else are u expecting?
