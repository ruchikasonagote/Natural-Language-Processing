#Pure Comedy
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*~Father John Misty*  

The comedy of man starts like this  
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips  
And so Nature, she divines this alternative  
We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever  greets us on the other end  
Is kind enough to fill us in  
And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever   since  

Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to   address  
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron     deficient  
So somebody's got to go kill something while I look    after the kids    
I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this   thing its milk?  
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we   can switch  
It's hard not to fall in love with something so   helpless  
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this  

Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy  
Just waiting until the part where they start to   believe  
They're at the center of everything  
And some all powerful being endowed this horror   show with meaning  

Oh, their religions are the best  
They worship themselves yet they're totally   obsessed  
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks,   these unbelievable outfits  
And they get terribly upset  
When you question their sacred texts  
Written by woman-hating epileptics  
 
Their languages just serve to confuse them  
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure  
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring  
And hand out prizes when someone patents the   cure  
Where did they find these goons they elected to   rule them?  
What makes these clowns they idolise so   remarkable?  
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new   gods   
So they can go on being godless animals  

Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but   to believe  
Their horizons that just forever recede  
And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a   prison of beliefs  
That they never ever have to leave  

Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman   would conceive!  
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive   is the struggle to survive  
But the only thing that they request is something   to numb the pain with  
Until there's nothing human left  
Just random matter suspended in the dark

fit1yqy,"“When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.”

― Jiddu Krishnamurti


Questioner :  Kindly give a straight reply. Does god exist, or not? Yes, or no? If yes, how best to realize him in this life?

JK : ""If you examine very closely, you have created god. Right? In India there are about – I was told there are about 300,000 gods and more. (Laughs) You understand? Every local person has his own god.

So, sirs, we have created god. See the irony of it. Thought has created god and then thought worships the image which thought has created. Which is, to worship oneself and call it god. You understand all this? – the better part of you is god. Right? I wonder if you understand this. First of all, let’s be clear. Have you created god? The local gods round the corner, or the local god in Rome, or in Tirupati, or wherever, you have created them, haven’t you? You are so very uncertain, aren’t you, so frightened. If you say we have created, then you are scared stiff because you have created out of your fear that. Out of your fear you want security. Right? You want safety, you want to feel there is somebody looking after you because you are afraid. You follow? So you create that, and then worship that. Just see what you are doing! Going to Tirupati and putting all your money in the bag – do you think gods want your money? Sir, look at it all. You have nothing to offer but money, garlands, prostrations, rituals. Right? You have nothing else to offer. Have you realised the tragedy of this, sirs?

If you love – not god, that’s very easy to love god because it is an abstraction, it has not much meaning. But if you love, that very love is god, that very love is sacred. You won’t go outside to look for god. You understand all this, sirs!

And the questioner wants to know if I believe in god. I don’t. Because god is something created by man. There is such a thing as eternity, which is to be outside of time. Right, sir? For that you must have a mind, a heart that is completely free from all the burdens of life. Right? From your vanity, your arrogance, your selfishness – you follow, sir? And we say, we are not capable of it, tell us what to do. You are back in the cycle, somebody to tell you what to do. Sir, you are in a jungle, you have to walk through it by yourself. Right? And for that you need vitality and vigour and strength. Not belief in god, in goodness – belief has no place where truth is concerned.

fitaf84,"Disclaimer first: I am 100% an atheist.

Having said that, the problem isn't religion in and of itself.

Most religious teachings usually boil down to 'care about others' and 'be a decent person'. Yes, there's a lot of fucked up stuff in the texts as well, not denying that. But a lot of people find comfort and strength in their beliefs, and you saying they should just let go of it because it's illogical and dumb, is frankly as intolerant as religious fanatics. Religion also does not have to be at odds with science and learning. I remember asking a religion teacher in school which is correct: The Big Bang or God made the world. She told me 'Both. The Big Bang happened, but God made it happen (obvs not something I believe, but not the point is) She also reiterated that the Bible is not literal. And she was a nun. And, as you may have heard, Einstein believed in God too. So, again, it's possible for both religion and scientific knowledge to coexist.

Organised religion is absolutely a problem. In my transition from Roman Catholic to atheist, I had a 'I believe in God, but not in the Church' phase. Religious organisations can be corrupt to the core. People twisting scriptures and teachings to suit their own agendas of hate and power are a problem. People using religion to support ignorance and prejudice that harms others (like being against the LGBTQ community, or anti vaxxers, or sects who believe medical intervention should not be allowed) are a problem. But religious people who use religion to find personal comfort, help others, and be part of a community? There is nothing wrong with that.

Yes, I still believe the world would be better off without religion, because of all of the people who exploit it and do so much harm in its name. But it is not my, or your, or anyone's place to dictate to someone what they should or should not believe in if they are not harming you in any way and just living their life peacefully. Because, again, if you do this, it makes you no better than religious nuts who want to dictate how we live our lives.",18,0,1582712005.0,lenny_ray,False,negative,neutral,negative,negative

But there is one point people here are missing. Religion does give people mental peace and a purpose to live especially when things are not going their way.

People want easy answers to questions and religion gives it to them. We may be rational in thinking that we can embrace tough times by just moving forward and waiting for things to become better but others are not. They can easily get depressed and go through mental problems.

People who derive pride from their religion go too far. To solve that they need to be educated and given fulfilling work. This won't stop them from being religious but it will at least give them a genuine reason to be proud.

Addicts. Afraid to believe the truth. That there's no order. There's no power. That all religions are just metastasizing mind worms, meant to divide us so it's easier to rule us by the charlatans that wanna run us. All we are to them are paying fanboys of their poorly-written sci-fi franchise. If I don't listen to my imaginary friend, why the fuck should I listen to yours?

""We need Religion for emotional and spiritual values""

You can hire a therapist for emotional support and simply buy a good telescope to look at the night sky, nothing is more spiritual than gazing at a clear night sky.

""In 20th century more people died by Nazis and commies who were atheists""

Nazis were not atheists, they were Christians who traditionally hated Jews (even the Protestants hate Jews, just look into Martin Luther's verses). Communists were atheists but weren't just entirely atheists. Its the classic saying, a communist can be an atheist but not all atheists are communist (especially proletarian dictatorship).

""You cannot ignore the good things that religious people do.""

You can do good things without being religious, there's this thing called humanity you know. 

""Being an atheist doesn't mean you're a good person""

Precisely the point, atheism is simply an absence of belief in a God and doesn't explain anything about a person's political or social inclinations. There were and are many bad atheists but unlike theist folks an atheist doesn't need to defend that evil person merely because they share that one specific philosophy.

""You cannot just remove religion like it does nothing""

That's true, religion does offer many good things. But as I said earlier, you can offer all those good things without invoking an omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient God.

""Atheists are just too arrogant""

Theists claim to know the mind of the omnipotent being which created this entire universe and yet atheists are the arrogant ones... Right.

""Religion and atheism are incompatible""

Not entirely true, it depends on one's definition of religion. If a religion doesn't need a God as a criterion then technically you can be an atheist and be part of a religion.

Religion is a meme. No, not in an Advice Animal kind of way, but if you go by the original meaning of a meme, it is an idea that compels people to propagate it. In this a meme behaves like an organism such as a virus. Thus, religion is a meme.

Another point to support this is that **religion does not exist without people**. Religion NEEDS people to survive, without people religion cannot exist.

This isn't something that's susceptible to rational argument, however. Your arguments aren't going to change the minds of the devout, and you aren't telling us anything new. Most of the violence in human history has been over material resources or ideology. Got it.

Instead of simply shitting on everyone who feels differently than you do, why not take a more scientific approach? *Why* do most people on earth subscribe to one religion? Why do humans believe in god(s)? Instead of just telling people that they're wrong (with numbers, charts, and diagrams to illustrate the depth of their wrongness,) isn't it time to address the more fundamental, underlying issues at work? Religion isn't something that's *being done* to people, it is ubiquitous, and it appears in isolated populations. As far as I know, there isn't a human culture, now or in historical record, that was without religion.

I suspect that your frustrations are caused by two things: religious or magical thinking, and a willingness to exploit people who rely on magical thinking. The first I find to be strange, and quite interesting, while the second is common and reprehensible. Don't confuse ""the church"" (or any other religious authority) with religious thought.

I'm an atheist, and I've never been part of any religion. I accept most of your position, but if you're willing to ask people to shed their beliefs and adopt yours, why don't you try a little experiment? For one month, learn all you can about one, particular religion. Learn about its history, art, culture, tenets, writings, and if possible spend time with adherents. Go to a house of worship, shrine, temple, or whatever. Set your reservations completely aside for one months, and immerse yourself. Deeply, honestly pursue an understanding. Leave your preconceptions behind (they'll be there at the end of the month when you need them,) and try it. If you pick Islam, pray five times a day. Whatever you pick, stick with it, and keep your critical mind on a shelf, for the moment.

fiuyxit,"'Fuck' religion that **tells people to go hurt/kill other people.** And 'fuck' **dogmatism.**

But on the other hand, your idea that religion is there simply to provide people comfort against ""death"" is not something I necessarily think is proper. For me, some religious afterlives are worse than just having nothing at all - e.g. Buddhist Hells.

>What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe.

From a really cold empirical science perspective, you can say, it almost surely won't. And if you're going to adopt that stance, you should be honest about that. Everything gets reduced to entropy in the end, photonic gas, and 99.9999% of us will be forgotten in no more than a few generations at the very best, and the few that aren't had a lot of probability work in their favor to get them there.

If you want to argue for a worldview rooted solely and purely in cold, hard empirical science, then you have to go **fully** honest about it and the things that *really* make me pop my head are not so much things filled up wholly with lies but which have a large quantity of truths and then *one little snag*.

And I'm not saying that somehow ""proves"" religion right. I'm saying that if you are going to argue it this way, you *should be* honest about it.

**Any** kind of *dogmatic ideology*, I find, is poison. It doesn't matter if it's religious or not. What matters is that it does not tolerate dissent. What matters is if you have decided those who refuse it are evil. All political ideologies go the same way, and the toxic effect of treating them dogmatically and intolerantly is every bit as plain as for religion. Interestingly, you have done just that, and said everyone who believes in religion is ""😈evil😈"". Good, I'll keep being 😈evil😈 then. Proud 😈Devil😈 here. Just as I'll keep being ""😈evil😈"" in the view of any other dogmatist who tells people to just suck up their dogma and don't critically evaluate each bit of it with a fine grained comb and I'll almost always find something to disagree with. Including ""religious"" dogmatists, too, of any stripe. Dogma systems are straitjackets for the mind. Any system that one cannot be flexible with or reserve adherence to all its tenets, inflexibly, rigidly, under threat of personal invalidation, is a mental straitjacket and exactly the kind of poison your *legitimate* points rightfully indict.

And believe it or not, saying ""I *believe"" or* ""I *don't believe*"" in ""God"", are *both* actually equally and more honest than saying ""I *know*"" the answer to this, or asserting it as an absolute fact. There is a hubris in both believing that we can *know* beyond the limits of our sense and empirical experience, as much as there is in believing that actual reality must be coterminous therewith. Neither such statement or confidence can be justified based on reason. We can only justify what we *have* verified empirically, and anything past that is where we must cease to condemn and chastize disagreement. In full honesty, we cannot even *know* the ""laws of physics"" continue forever. Our empirical evidence, our *experience*, gives us no reason to *suspect* they will break, and can give us *confidence* in them, but they just *might*, and maybe there are places they don't apply that we haven't found yet. One can, of course, pull out the Russell tea pot argument and say it's irrelevant, but my point is not to argue its relevance any more than its correctness, but rather to argue against your moralism of people, which is as reprehensible as that which has flowed from the mouth of any authoritarian religious preacher in any religion.

People should not be considered vile for *whatever* they believe in this matter. I have no problem with you going for atheism, I have a **big** problem with you calling people evil, simply on dint of a *belief*. **That** is what leads to all the horrible things you rightfully indict.  You or someone like you may become the next persecutor. The only way to stop persecution is for everyone to respect disagreement.

And no, I'm not then saying ""persecute the persecutor"" or ""persecute the ones who say people are evil"". I am voicing both my own disagreement and my intent to not be daunted by your taunts.",2,0,1582750773.0,mike3,1582752200.0,negative,negative,negative,negative

fit9uah,"Yes, by all probablility, God does not exist, and even if He does, it is of no consequence since God doesn't interfere in any way we can see. However, I strongly disagree with your notion that religion is the 'root of all evil'. History proves that religuous societies tend to be more successful, likely because people tend to shy away from crime or disobedience if they feel that 'a higher power is watching them.'

More importantly, religion provides us with hope, something to be happy about and look forward to in grim times. What if there were no Christmas or Diwali or Eid? Life would be rather monotonous and dull. The greatest works of art, literature, music, even science were inspired by religion, be it Sufi ghazals, Rennaissance frescos, or Hindu epics. Yes it is true, communal tension and xenophobia is largely a product of religious extremism, but ultimately, religion has done more good than harm.

In the 'grand scheme of things' religion and humanity itself is undoubtably insignificant.

fitmvxl,"I totally get where you are coming from and I agree that most of religion is outdated, but I do not believe that it is pointless. My grandma is 70. She has nothing in life remaining other than religion. She would be sitting at home right now just letting her body go to waste but instead she goes to the temple every single day. It gives her purpose. Does that make her weak or a coward afraid of death? I think not. You might have come to terms with the fact that this life goes nowhere and just comes to an end, but it is not an easy concept to grasp. And it gets more and more horrible of a thought the closer you get to death when your body is in pain and your friends and family are withering away. 

Religion provides two things: community and a moral code. Community in the sense that even if you go somewhere where you are out of place, you will find a small group of like minded individuals through the local church or temple or mosque. It is kind of a support system, an extended family. And most importantly, it provides a moral code. Not everyone is born a genius with a perfectly set line on what is good or bad. It is taught. Which is why you can see certain traits throughout religions communities. 

The problem with religion stems in two things: outdated logic-less rituals and religious supremacy. For the first point, there are outdated rituals like not letting females cook or go to the temple during periods that need to be understood and shut down. In the past, when people did not have an understanding of periods and females speaking up was taboo, this ""rule"" made them exempt from their most important daily duties- cooking and going to the temple. It is of course not relevant anymore because people actually talk about periods and understand them and husbands aren't going to force their wives to cook when they are in pain and just need to rest for a bit. The second, and more harmful problem, is religious supremacy. Christianity and Islam actually believe that they are the highest form of religion and their path is the only true path. This is obviously a toxic mindset which belittles everyone else and also why there are religious missionaries trying to convert people into their religion. Hinduism is actually a very inclusive religion that says that there are many paths in life and you can be a good person no matter what path you choose. Unfortunately, this concept is getting lost on a lot of people and hence why we have seen a rise of hindutva.

 A person with ""**kindness**"" as a dominant trait would shower it for everyone alike,  as a flower cant be selective in spreading its fragrance to  the audience of its choosing.

Humans are consciously evolved beings, powered by probably the universes most sophisticated nervous system, & backed by a vast database of genome & cellular memories.

Example, ever ask a child or toddler to kill a bird or conduct this act in-front of her, and it  would not matter which race or religion this child belongs to, they all will show a similar reaction, and express themselves similarly.

That\`s the natures **""inner toolkit**"" working providing hints to ""**right direction /Choices**""

Why not try and apply all these gifts of chromosomes inbuilt in us, to evaluate & choose for ourselves. Running their discourse on the logic, historical and geographical evidences, experiences and other tools available. - Scientific discovery essentially.

As far as all the misery of the world is concerned, root cause of it everywhere would be the individuals selfishness, and ignoring the hints provided by this inner toolkit. *aka, that faded voice from heart*

We under the influence of **selfishness enticed by greed** , ignored these hints from our innate toolkit, for so long that sadly it has stopped coming anymore for most part...

So, now we are left on the mercy of **""Books""**, **"" scriptures""** and self proclaimed gurus... 

There was a time when there were no books or written scriptures, everyone was relying on the **hints provided by this innate toolkit..**

and then greed and selfishness flashed and some one, at some point, for the first time, must have dared to ignore the hints from inner toolkit and decided to chose otherwise.. That\`s how it begin!

Rest copied, the trend followed and it took us all here... those opposed were ignored or crushed! This is what modern history tells us.

That\`s how & (why must have )  written religious scriptures,  avatars, gurus,  happened on different point of this timeline of deliberate corruption  & suppression of **""inner hints""**

The scriptures and avatars are there to just to remind us humans that we possess a unique toolkit but we are forgetting to use it, and it is not good for us in the long term....

You see, all the religions on this planet in their depths have only pointed us humans to listen to  ""**this inner toolkit**"", where real knowledge happens.

Eventually, some day in the future, a majority of humans will find a way to pay attention to the hints coming from this inner toolkit. 

And all fake knowledge and religions creating illusion of different paths will collapse. As everyone would have the access to the truth and one end. 

In nutshell, all the religion in their current format are serving a purpose, which is to guide humans to somewhere, point them in some direction, and alluring them to walk a path of their choosing...

Apparently, those who were entrusted with the authority to continue poke and remind humans about this core stuff  got corrupted themselves /Stopped listing to their inner toolkit..Some got hijacked (influence of greed / Self interest ) 

In present format majority of these custodians of the original message are only disclosing what suits their interest.

Which is,  taking people to the different extended recursive paths while smartly hiding the essence.  Fitting their vested interests. 

And that\`s causing all the confusion & creating this massive illusion that end destination is also a different place at the end of every path. 

You would see...

yet, IMO, every individual  still has got some access left to this toolkit. We all agree that everyone who lived in the end has to die. All path must converge to one. As all rivers of the world become one water in the vast ocean. 

There are everyday experiences we chose to ignore. 

Those who would continue to ignore ""this hint from the inner toolkit""  will continue to be confused and disillusioned... 

 Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. 

Evil = Bad, and Right = Good  today are mere a label we put to our action based on its outcome. if they suit our interest, label it as good act, otherwise a bad one., isn\`t so!

Does any other animal labels any of their act as a good or a evil ? 

As evident from the above, all the labels of evil and good are inside us, this hint coming from ""**inner toolkit**""  had always picked up the right label without a fail. Or else majority of humans would have been murderers, thieves,  and humanity would not have made this far!

Point is, that nothing is that bad externally, we have chose to ignore the majority of these inner hints as they contradict with our modern definition of good and bad. (Selective / always in self interest ) 

Recent population explosion across the globe has added mostly this ""type(s) of human""  one heavily conditioned  with no support of this **""inner toolkit""** and hence all the chaos we see in the world, as no one has got a clue about what is right or wrong. It is pure selfishness and greed. 

It is us as individuals, who need a fix. 

Start with giving importance to the hints originating from **""Inner toolkit""** which is far more superior and work of millennium of evolution.",1,0,1582730876.0,redsam18,False,negative,neutral,neutral,neutral

Guess what: I don't hate religion. You know who I hate? People who do wrong, no matter if they are religious or not.

I am atheist, but my mother is not, but she doesn't believe in any religious bullshit, she is just a normal person who is by herself sure that there is a god, but she never wanted anything from me cause of that or others. Every time I see those hate posts about religions, I think about my mother, and question why people would wanna hate her? She is the most loving and caring person I ever met in my life, and my friends and visitors i get all approve that, especially her food ;). Can you imagine how that feel if someone says what your mother does is bad, although it isn't? That is the key problem here, you are saying ALL religion, while you should be angry about the ACTIONS, hating religions means that you are not particular being angry about the ACTIONS that they have done to you, it means that you hate EVERYBODY of them, it means that you hate those WHO NEVER had harmed anybody, who never had imposed their religion on others.

You say to fuck a group of people where there are a majority who have never done anything wrong. And now those people can use that as argument against you, cause you are not particular pointing those things out that are missing in your country WHICH EXIST IN OTHER COUNTRIES, like CLEAR splitting of religion and government. You have practical no idea how life is in a country with splitting of religion and government, AND STILL, you want to hate _ALL RELIGION_, which means you are also hate those people here in Germany who follow a religion that never influenced their life or the life of others. This is despicable and actually helps those people who are really wrong, who abuse religion to get into power who abuse religion to stay in power, cause they just can point to the harmless people an d say ""Why you hate those?""

You are literally hating people for the actions of others, which is the same as racist do. You are like a racist cause you are not pointing to those who did wrong, you point to ALL and say they are all wrong, cause of the actions of other people. All this hate in the world is just disgusting. Be ashamed, inform yourself about the world, and start liking the good parts and pointing to the bad parts, and not point to parts which are used for good and bad in the world just because you are too stupid to open your eyes.

I also want to point out: Isn't it funny how you describe how people should be living together and reflect in those sentences the way religion is used in modern civilization, in those countries which split religion from government. It is kinda disturbing that you have no idea how the world rotates and believe everybody is living in a shithole where religious people take action in the society. Just disturbing and totally stupid to fire up broadsword against people you do not even know, you have no experience with, you just know those in your shithole, but want to condemn those in other countries without even knowing how they are doing in other countries.

fiudj0m,"The word religion. There are so many interpretations of that word. There is the Catholic religion, the Christian, the Protestant and the innumerable divisions of Protestantism, and there is Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhs and so on. So many religions in the world, organised, some are brutal, the Islamic world and so on. So what do you consider is religion, the word? Is it the search for human beings something outside of their own daily life, something other than their petty self-centred activity, beyond their cruelty, bestiality and their vulgarity and all the rest of that? Is it that human beings have always sought from the most ancient of times something beyond themselves? If we consider that, something beyond themselves, beyond their daily life, then that becomes a religion of escape, which probably most religions are, as they are now. It is not connected with their daily existence. It is based on belief, on a book, or on faith, or on some dogma, rituals, the repetition of daily rituals which goes on practically all over the world - incense, dressing up, fancy dress and all that. All that, prayer included, is called leading a religious life, going, as they do in India at one time three times a day to the temple, and the Islamic world five times prayer, and the Sunday mass and so on. So this is considered religious, or rather a religious attitude. We are questioning that.

I would like rather to question the whole nature and the structure of present day religion. There are so many sects. They have found that Christianity is very limited, so they go off to Buddhism, or to some kind of sectarian gurus and so on, the multiplication of this search for something other than the daily boredom, daily loneliness, the constant conflict and so on. This has been the pattern. - Jiddu Krishnamurti

But by far this absolutely harsh ideology is forcing your own beliefs just as others forced theirs on you. It makes you no better than them, and to be honest everyone needs to understand it’s not okay to force your beliefs on others.

That’s all that needed to be said, not this rant that slams and insults people that have done nothing to you. I can counter argue that those in some religions would likely have a less brute force approach and not be so callous and reckless with their words. Words hurt others, words start wars, words are like the bullets that provide ammo for evil and tyrannical agendas. 

Take a step back and realize you have no control, this shout into the void is useless. You’re doing it for comfort or recognition which is only temporary in the grand scheme of things. Applause fades, the curtains close, and you’re left standing there feeling good about yourself for the wrong reasons. 

The best way to detest religion is not to recognize them at all or give the energy you have up in an attempt to put them “on blast” so to speak. You don’t believe, good for you, many others are like you. But just because you don’t believe doesn’t mean others CAN’T believe.

fiuf9lm,"My 2 cents

I don't even know where to begin. Further more, I think that most don't realise the kind of argument you guys are putting forth.

I kinda understand where this thought begins but tbh it is just as good as any other scapegoat. We are so desperate to find a solution out of the misery and problems we are surrounded by that we make another scapegoat. The way in which responses are written in this thread shows the other bitter side of the coin.

From a completely neutral point of view, advocating for the removal of religion is as radical of an idea as some religion advocating for the banishment of the other religion (like what you see in the events unfolding). BUT wait... you could say, I as a non-religious ""unbiased person"" am seeking betterment for the society (I will overlook the way everyone on this thread places moral anchorage as if something like that even exists in this viewpoint - ""good and bad?"" What are those terms?), anyway, back to the point, you have done the same by placing yourself on a false pedestal dictating the terms and the way you present them as absolute.

So...

What is the true solution if you want to dismantle any , and I mean any false beliefs?
Simple - Engage in discussion and do not throw some belief out of the window or portray it as radical just because you don't like it. This way, we can have a society that actually progresses by engaging with the other and not by ""marginalising"" the other. Calling our groups to hate and laugh on the ideas of the other can also not lead to a harmonious society. Remember, you can come to similar terms on many issues by talking and listening to the other with an intent to understand

Ultimately no one knows what happens after death and no one will ever be able to know until you die yourself. So what's wrong with hoping for something peaceful, especially when the entire concept of non existence is an unknown and scary thought to the vast majority. A good friend of mine who I care for has anxiety attacks from just thinking of this concept of unending blackness of nothingness. So what's wrong with finding peace in thinking of something different?

Personally I'm agnostic. Because theres no way to know, I dont think its logical to claim anything with certainty solely based off what anyone believes is true. But I dont think theres anything wrong with hoping for peace in the afterlife especially if it gives you peace of mind while you're alive.

Edit: After reading through the rest of your post I agree with mostly everything else, but i still dont think it's right to generalize religion like that. I agree the extreme side of religion is bad. There is a problem with anything when it turns into tribalism. Or when it makes people ignorant and unable to live in reality.

Especially when there are a lot of good churches who help those in need with their personal problems, somewhat in the same way as therapy.

You can inspire others to do right on a spiritual level by setting a good example. Leader or show others what you think/believe is the best way to live life and exist. 

However, what business is it of yours if others use their own spirituality or religion to give themselves hope or to have faith... a motivation or purpose for their own existence.  

Spirituality & Faith regardless of a specific religion can, in certain individual cases, be a lifestyle someone of their own free will chooses to just get by and live as best they can.  

Why leave any faith and ""come back to the real world"" if someone's faith and spirituality is their own personal motivation for being a good person, and just being good in general. 

In my personal point of view maybe you should calm down and think about what you wrote down. We are not all the same and we all can be divided by anything not just religion. Are you going to use someone's religion as a way to scapegoat and discriminate against someone as an individual just because of their religion?

Judge someone as an individual by getting to know them & not just making blanket assumptions based on something so superficial as what religion an individual chooses to believe in.

Of course any high school student with a functioning brain can tell that most religious concepts are fictional and outright bullshit. But because something is not real doesn't make it invalid and irrelevant. Human nature like that of any animal on earth is filled with hate, violence and raw evil as abundantly as the good side of humanity. We are capable of things far far worse than what we are led to believe in this overly protected and privileged life that we lead. Without any rules for morality or shackling our need to present our shadow to the world, we would have destroyed ourselves long ago. Religion just happened to be the best model we have for working at this. Even as of now we haven't found any sustainable alternatives and most literature, from Jung to modern day psychologists, agrees with this. Yes it sucks that people believe in fairy tales and kill each other to defend their stories, but for now our civilization isn't grown enough to handle no religion on a global scale. As an atheist it makes me extremely sad but that's the way things are. As for the bright side of things, some stuff off top of my head.

It's my personal belief that one can unlock their true potentials by freeing themselves of the ridicules imposed by their religions and gods and work for the greater good of humanity.

fiul3b1,"Full disclosure: I'm currently a Christian, but I have serious doubts about my faith. I appreciate the skepticism of your post, but there are some things I disagree with.

>You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.

So what? Even if people are only religious because they're scared of death, this wouldn't make religion false. 

>Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe. What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.

Why do you support ""faith in people"", but not religious faith? Isn't faith the very thing you are trying to eradicate? If you're against believing things without evidence, then both kinds of faith should be wrong. Also, your claim that we control our destiny seems incompatible with materialism(I assume you don't believe in souls), as then we would be subject to physical laws.

>Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

I disagree with your second sentence there. Many of the great scientists of the past were religious. George Lemaitre, who developed the Big Bang theory, was a Catholic priest. The monk Gregor Mendel's work on heredity is crucial for our modern understanding of evolution. Those are just two examples. However, I'll be the first to admit that religion and science haven't always been harmonious, but I don't think they're entirely incompatible either. 

Additionally, why do you think ""nothing divides us except religion""? Unless you're defining religion super broadly, I'm unconvinced of this. In my experience, politics is just as, if not more, divisive. Also, religion can unite people by giving them a common purpose and meaning.

I sincerely don't mean to downplay the religious violence going on in India. It is absolutely terrible and there is no justifying it. However, I would challenge the idea that religion itself is entirely to blame. If religion were to be wiped off the earth tomorrow, I doubt that evil people would go away, and the regimes of Stalin and Pol Pot are evidence of this. The real problem, in my view, is ideological extremism and the gullibility of people to go along with it. These problems can occur whether religion exists or not.

One final point: Throughout your post you say that humans have an obligation to make the world better. My question is: What is the evidence that this obligation exists, and why should anyone follow it?

fiunzvr,"

The problem doesn't lie in religion itself but the institutionalization happed after they were formed. I am a Hindu and I like to read different school of thoughts in  sanatan dharma. The main problem of today's religion and their followers is they have very institutionalized thought processes. India is the land of seekers. We have embraced atheism long before it was ""Cool"". You can look for Charvaka school of philosophy which is basically seeking truth in the form of materialism and atheism. I partly agree that religion is root cause of major problems in world today but that is not because of religion it self but what humans did with it. We pitted each religion against each other to justify our war mongering nature. If you closely observe historical timeline you'll observe that majority of wars that were fought on basis of religion, were in times when there were very few advances in philosophies of each religion. Religion is meant to serve personal values but unfortunately we humans have used it to justify our actions. 

For the fellow atheists here, I respect your choice of atheism. But we are the part devil of this world as well. And lastly why don't we blame Science for creation of nuclear weapons which can annihilate world in matter of minutes?

fiuodhf,"You try to make a fair argument, but the basic idea of religion is the shared belief on being moral.

It may sound like stating the obvious but there is a difference with being moral and in believing it.

To some it may be a small difference to others not.

(For example filtering the world in our conscience to have a good inner voice. What ever we think, we try to think in a certain positive way. 

Rather than not necessarily believing, and just see how we feel about the situation. How we process the world is Thus different. The filter is of our own making and random.

And it might affect a person in the sense they feel less empathy or care less especially when no one is watching.

They might forget to process things in a certain way, and their language might also change and their emotions as a result as well.)

But also to make things more obscure we are dealing with a world that is religious, so how can you say that people not believing in being good is going to make them better especially when no one is watching?

We are also dealing with a lot of benefits and welfare, what will happen to the morality of people in a moment of crisis if they don’t have the custom of believing in being good?

I can understand The want to make the world a better place, but freedom of religion is the best to hope for. Trying to change the dynamics too much is another uncertainty.

For example can you guarantee security and wealth so people are not dealing with circumstances that may be ‘believing’ morality will have more benefits than not (presumably).

I think if people want to make the world a better place it comes from those things in improving people’s lives. That is with technology. And I think we don’t quite have that level of technology to quite easily say that abandoning a belief system will be better. Since even being just moral, implies some kind of belief in a constitution to make it work in tough times, when no one is watching. For example almost every country is dealing with a significant amount of corruption, will them having less faith, or not having to pretend to be ‘faithful’ have more positive effects on corruption or not?

Ona global scale religion is different than before. The conversation regarding religion in public generally involves people being and ‘acting’ good. At least they have to ‘act’ good which is still important imo. There is a net benefit not just how it translate to a certain culture of caring, or good action but also the psychological impact it can have to be an inclusive society rather than one that is more capitalistic and is a dog eat dogs world.

I think by rejecting the belief in being good, rather than just common sense or common interests Of being good, can quickly shift human behavior to be more unhealthy. We can also look at humans being savage without laws and instructions. Their natural state is quite barbaric, which is why the point of technology and being a utopia is important. The barbaric humans of the past did not have a belief system and even if they did, their lives were too extreme to have a use for it. It took humans a long time to reach this level of society and religion was their crutch for good or bad. Which is why it is a big uncertainty due to their basic nature and their dependence on religion, to say wether they would be good without religion.

Just like philosophers of the past have studied human behavior and some will say humans need to be taught to be good to be good.",1,0,1582745233.0,OutofthisForce,1582746889.0,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

fiuq1qx,"As I was reading this post, I could only think of the Quote from ""Pale Blue Dot"" by Carl Sagan 

""  hat's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.   ""

fiuq1so,"You can have your religions AND be loyal to your species. Don't worry about religion if you don't want a part in it. Every person is an individual autonomous person, so why are you going to spend so much time being against their decisions? Just enjoy your own way, and if these are your complaints, then be, in your character, the way  you want to see others in your world act. Just because some people are, of my personal opinion, stupid and warlike, doesn't really mean that Religion is the primary cause. Sure, religion is easy to blame, because people like to use it as a way to justify their aggression and transgressions by ""Invoking the law of the lord"" or some other mindless and willful reason.

People are afraid to change their ways of life, and religious discrimination has been the main cause of unrest in India, usually not religion in and of itself. Religion is a positive thing, you can't just stop something from existing because you hate it. How about nurturing it into something that can actually be positive and helpful to the world?

Avoiding conflict is often as simple as moving forward. When you put down your weapons and abandon your conflicts, progress happens. Happy lives can happen. Simple as that.

Sorry to burst your bubble love, but you seem a lot more childish with your little temper tantrum then any random religious person just minding their own business. 

I understand where you’re coming from, to atheists people of faith may easily appear as delusional fools who pray to a god to make themselves feel better about their existence...but who are we to take that from them? Who are we to snatch away their hope so cruelly? If it makes them happy, and indeed, encourages them to live a more moral lifestyle for fear of god’s wrath or the afterlife, then what is the harm? 

You accuse them of being foolish to believe in man made stories, but science is the same in that regard...in my eyes, the latter has far more credibility, but it is still just another concept manning has come up with in a desperate attempt to explain the word around us. 

It is, with all due respect, simply idiotic to say religion is the only thing that divides us...mankind is capable of deep kindness and empathy, but we are also capable of mindless hatred and violence. It is not religion to blame, but us. We allow any and all differences to divide us, be they religion, economic status, race, nationally, gender, sexual identity, or even age...it is foolish to try and blame religion for the endless bloodshed we cause. 
Indeed, it could easily be argued that, using your vehement rant as an example, it is also the very lack of religion that divides people.

I am not claiming religion is a force for good, but it is not a force for evil either. Merely a tool, used and twisted by humans for their own purposes. Some use it for good, spreading love and support, others use it to pit people against each other. Attack the people misusing it, not the religion itself. Do not give those people the excuse of blaming their religion. Their actions are their own.

Being an atheist does not mean you have to hate religion, or people who follow one. We pride ourselves on our oh so great logic, and then go around mindlessly mocking and hating people of faith, for what? Because it provides an easy scapegoat for us to take our frustrations with the world out on? If it helps them live a happier life, so be it! 

Live and let live!

Sorry for the long and drawn out response everyone, but I cannot understand why atheists insist on such a harsh attitude towards religion. 

Just because someone of some religion may have hurt you, doesn’t make religion inherently bad. Indeed, there are elements of religions that anyone could benefit from, e.g. meditiation

fiuwgk4,">A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals and started making clay potteries, we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. **The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age.**

You're full of shit, buddy. All those discoveries Man found and made use of also facilitated murder, genocide, and invasions. This was done *eons* before the concept of religion was ever a thing, yet you don't point that out.

>Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion.

Except genetic research have discovered many biological nuances in different ethnicities. So no, we are not the same.

Two sides of the same coin , each making up eachother 

“The rishis tell us of the galactic center of the universe, which feeds energy to all the galaxies and solar systems of the universe. A modern discovery is beginning to reinforce this belief. To explore this three centers must be identified, 1) the center of a solar system (Sun), 2) The center of a galaxy, 3) the galactic center of the universe. Our focus here will be on the first two centers. In exploring these two centers we will discover the current Hindu principles of Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu at work. Those these same principles can be explored using the galactic center of the universe also.” https://www.boloji.com/articles/1490/modern-black-hole-theory

Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder? I agree thoroughly with a lot of the points you have made (obviously quite passionately), however to sum up the net worth of religion in society as '' mass murder and hardship'' is quite juvenile and quite frankly, false. Science and Religion are separate facets in social lives that are personal to each individual. All major world religions base their beliefs on pre existing human morals and either give them a narrative or an incentive to uphold traditional moral values. I personally believe a breakdown in faith and lack of belief in the preexisting religious moral institution led to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s and look where that left us.

'' Leave your religion'' - I genuinely hope that was passionate rhetoric rather than what you truly believe. Any anti-freedom of religion country would be morally bankrupt. Freedom of expression and freedom of speech are essential to any working democracy. The same passionate rhetoric in reverse would be condemned by the media as crude conversion tactics.

fl6ssb8,"Let me just start off by saying that humans are always looking for idols. This idol has to be a representation of a person. It can be a politician, a teacher, or anything. Indian teens often look at Bollywood celebrities and cricketers as their idols. Therefore, it's a human tendency to look out for idols. However, all these idols are human. When these humans make mistakes, their hard-earned idol breaks. In this comparison to this human idol, the idols of God are the best alternative. They represent perfection, and they can never break. This is because Gods are believed to never make mistakes and always provide the best path in life. That's why people so blindly believe in them.

Now that clear, I wanna say that if you want to break religion today, then it's possible. You can truly break these idols. However, I can guarantee you that there will be something that will pop up in the next 100-500 years. It doesn't have to be mainstream religion like today. Science can turn out to be a religion possibly when we discover some fundamental truth, and we can become so arrogant that we will forget to look at other perspectives except the laws of physics. 

The reason for this permanent existence of religion is not the blind faith of people but the source of order in our society. In the 12 Rules For Life by Jordan Peterson, Peterson brings a compelling argument that in our world, and possibly the universe, there are forms of **order** and **disorder**.  This is the true meaning of the Chinese philosophical concept of Yin and Yang. The popular symbol of the two white and black fishes. The white represents order, hierarchy, cultures, discipline, faith, traditions while the black represents disorder: freedom, innovation, creativity, disorder, chaos, unpredictability, no-rules. What's so interesting is that you can see this duality around you. I definitely recommend you all to read this book. Note that both sides of the model have positive and negative impacts.  So basically, an ideal society is one that has a balance of both. But historically this hasn't been so. You will observe the whole human race making radical shifts from one state to another. When there are too many wars and there is no morality in people, then a new religion arises and attempts to create peace by asserting codes by which people can adhere to. This is a shift towards order. However, with time, the rules only grow and become overpowering to an extent that the religion may appear as oppression or tyranny. Then our society has a rebel who rallies and breaks the religion restoring freedom and free speech. To do this the rebel takes away all the existing rules. But then after some time, with this new freedom, people lose their moral codes.  They take advantage of this freedom and our whole free society turns out to be a blunder. 

The point is that religion or anything in the world is not good or bad. In my perspective, if you promote hate against religion, then there is no difference between you and those religious people who convey the same feelings against atheists and heathens. You are equally as ignorant as them. 

I completely agree that under religion, so many innocents had to suffer. However, I believe that is not true religion. Religion today has become a tool for politicians to sway public support, at least in India. There are riots, arsons, violent crimes, rapes, torture, and so many atrocities committed to defending religion. There are also these so-called spiritual babas that teach ways of ignorance and bigotry.

The problem arises because people feel that religion is told to them. To me, no Godamn retard can tell me what to do, what my religion is! Religious knowledge or spiritual knowledge actually arises from within. You have to sense your soul yourself. A guru only helps you in recognizing yourself. A soul and consciousness may be meaningless to you, and I respect the opinion. To me, the exploration of this soul is aesthetic and worth it.

I believe I'm a religious person. I'm a Hindu. Yet my religion or my own taking of it doesn't force me to hate other religions. Rather I'm quite fascinated by Sufism, and it's my dream to go to the Nizamuddin Dargah. Religion does not make me feel that I matter or that God will come and help me from my misery.

I don't know if you go to college, office, school, etc, but people of different cultures, religions, regions, etc work/study together. You don't normally see them killing each other over religion. Why do riots happen? Who participates in riots? First analyse the situation, people involved, people who started it or provoked it. 
Look I could have taken offense when you wrote ""F* Islam"", but I didn't because I know that you're pissed and me giving you the finger on the internet is childish. Religious extremism is really bad because it distracts you from the actual religion that you're following. Extremism teaches you exactly the opposite what the message religion wants to convey. It would be more appropriate if you abused ISIS. 
Those people who think that by killing people of other religion is okay will be acceptable by God, they couldn't be more wrong. They will be punished. Everyone's time will come.

I agree with your rant that all religions have done till now is creating rift and disruption amongst the people of the world. But, that's just a commentary on the aspect of religion followed by the majority of the population and not religion in itself. 

Religion is not going to temples, not eating beef, reciting mantras, singing hymns, making ashrams, subscribing to gurus and holier than thou attitude. Religion is more than that. There's a beauty to it. The philosophies proposed in Hindu scriptures are mesmerizing and intellectually stimulating. The simple rituals prescribed by the scriptures are nourishing to the mind and body. These are some of the beautiful aspects of religion. It's not degrading, discriminatory or condescending towards anyone. Following the crux of a religion requires no violence or any untoward activity. The philosophies outlined in religion basically provides tools and capabilities for better introspection into our existence.

The question of how and why we are here is the essence of all scientific pursuits. Religion/spirituality is just another way to approach the problem. Thousands of years of spiritual research and development has provided us with tools to understand life a little better. This is an alternative to the approach of going with a blank slate or not thinking about it altogether. It's like scientific research, where the knowledge from the past researcher helps to develop our own theories and understanding about a phenomenon. That's what Hindu religion is supposed to mean, at least to me.

 No they aren't, you aren't cursing religion you're cursing the man.  
I've read the Upanishads, The meditations of Marcus Aurelius and Man's search for meaning by Viktor Frankl recently. All very different philosophies all preaching the importance of understanding one another.       
 A book does not make a man kill just as Eminem is not to be blamed for when Stan kills in his name. Evil be as evil do. People are as bad as there actions, we are only as good as virtuous we are. What your source of virtue is, is your interpretation of life and how to live it. When man feels lost he turns to religion, I talk of the answers inside. When you cannot decide how to live your life and feel lost it shines like a guiding philosophy. Some say that all actions and universe is god and must be treated reverently, others say God is dead so find virtue in self. If you really study and interpret these books they all say that happiness comes from love and finding purpose in life. By having an opinion balanced between karma and parmatma, for they are seperate (Isha Upanishads) and by having a spirit of tyag/sacrifice can one escape the cycle of karm and achieve moksha. The same says Marcus Aurelius that one cannot control anything but there own happiness. 
Religion is what you make of it, a good man will use it as an aid to gain virtue and the man living in Andhakar will use it do evil.",1,0,1589933756.0,jaeger123,1589934185.0,negative,negative,negative,negative

fit4ote,"If you're truly an atheist, a true atheist in word, thought and acts, then for you there should be no concern at all. Because as per your ideology no one has any choice in any matter as the laws of physics and chemistry coupled with the initial conditions of the Big Bang force people to behave exactly as they do. 

Hence, if you inspite of adhering to this ideology try to comment here, fully aware that everyone is genetically determined, so no one should convince anyone, as freewill is non-existent, and hence getting offended or hurt or disagreement are just illusions of a random oscillation. 

Further, if someone wants to blame God, then first accept the existence of God. Don't put blame on someone that as per them doesn't even exist, cause then they're just an emotionally induced atheist, with their roots in emotion not logic, creating principles of evil or good when such principles don't exist in nature. 

If however, you first accept God and hence you want to blame him then you should ask the question - Why should people not suffer, including a child, a seemingly helpless animal or any other. Why is it that they shouldn't suffer? When the question of evil arises, the actual subliminal question that people ask is - ""Why isn't God behaving as per my desire?"" I want to live forever he makes me die, I want unlimited sex, he creates obstacles, I want unlimited tasty treats, he creates fat, diabetes, I want unlimited intoxication he creates drug trauma, whatever I want to do, he creates problems? Why? It's because a compassionate father not only treats but punishes when you do wrong. And the wrong is not just for one birth, but cyclical, and accumulative, when you keep ignoring it, it grows and one day it just bursts. When the worm is eaten by a cat, then one may think the worm suffered, but scriptually the jeeva soul in that worm got trasmuted into a sperm and then born as a kitten, and so on the cycle continues. 

The desire of fools is material pleasure without any sort of disturbance. Disturbance in enjoying such insignificant pleasure is what is regarded as evil by fools. Death, murder, destruction, disease, and suffering of all kinds is the actual evil and all these evils are sent accordingly by God as per your degree of attachment to such material pleasures. The law of karma works in this way - suppose as per some past act you have to die through a head wound, that karma will make someone who wants to beat someone, who has the desire to beat someone, like a gangster come to you, or you go the gangster, the gangster will beat on the head, and then in the future he too will suffer for murdering someone. In this way one being's desire of beating someone and another's beings deservement both are carried out simultaneously. God will fulfill your desire, no matter how evil it is, one day it shall come to pass, in this life or another, but so will it's consequences. Giving up desires or kaama is the basis of liberation or moksha. Kaliyuga is that age when the pending evil desires of beings is heavily unleashed. It's not God making them behave in this fashion, they want to do it themselves. They like killing babies, they like blowing things up, they like raping and looting, and killing the masses, carving their flesh and drinking till they're dead, and birth after birth they keep suffering. 

Out of all the wars, murders, crimes almost all of them have one or more of these 3 motives - 
Lust, Anger or Greed, all of which are categorically curbed in any bonafide religion. 

Holocaust, Holodomor, The Cambodian genocide of 1975, The Armenian Genocide of 1915, the Zunghar genocide etc. which killed 7 times more people than the two world wars combined have been done by the irreligious. You're doing the same thing which you accuse religion of - Collective hate. 

As for the OP, I'm not here to convince anyone, but to say that please behave as per the ultimate conclusions of your own ideology, which is Atheism here, like a random oscillation with no friends or enemies, with no concept of good or evil, as such concepts are imaginary as per the same logic applied. Please practice such atheism ardently. Also, yeah I post at a sub that many people here are averse to, and yeah its because atleast I can say my say over there.

now in terms of living in the society; Religion also tells about different characteristics of a human being-

1. mode of goodness
2. mode of passion

3 mode of ignorance

now following religion also gives you inner piece (eg; chanting ""ohm"" brings inner piece in yourself   and makes you feel more connected and relaxed).

fitbiue,"Saying 'Fuck all religion' on Reddit is like saying 'Nazis suck' to a Jew ( or well, anyone with a brain because Nazis do suck, period.)

But you get my point. It's basically preaching to the choir.

Personally, I am spiritual. Not sure if religious but definitely spiritual. I have seen the capacity of religion and spirituality to do good. Yes, a lot of people-in-power use it for their own personal ends and many corrupt their original teachings but that doesn't negate the numerous truly good religious people in the world.

Faith is a fickle thing. It truly gives some people purpose. And I'm not referring to the ones who corrupt it and use it for violence, no. I'm talking about normal, everyday people who wish to go about their lives being decent human beings.

No religion, by itself, promotes violence, murder or hurting your fellow man ( as far as I am aware). It's a tool that was intended to keep people from turning bad. And tools can be used for both good and bad.

Saying 'Fuck all Religion' is easy to say to an Atheist-majority community. The same way it's easy to say 'Fuck all Hindus' to a group of Islamic extremists or 'Fuck all Muslim' to a group og Hindutva extremists. It's just a different form of hate.

fite9jh,"I know u r saying this as u r watching what's happening in our country. When it comes to religion, people of power deceive and manipulate the general public to continue enjoying power. Look at the positive side of religion. I was brought up in a family where my parents r atheists and follow Marxism (As Marx said Religion is the opium of the masses; I agree with the statement) but I became a theist.
Every religion is based on some common values giving up materialism, power, greed and rest everyone knows.
Religion may play a big role in the current conditions of our country but u know anyone who truly understands any religion will give up their worldly lives. There r many cases in atheists have been the cause of genocide, take examples of Lenin and Mao. This is not a matter of religion, religion is just instrumental and a tool for these political goons to unite muscle power towards other particular minorities.
If there is no religion and God specifically we r left behind with the Existential question why r we here?, and any sane mind will never believe we r random product of our universe and the universe cant come into existence from nothing. I have studied years of science and philosophy.

Ultimately if there is no God our existence is meaningless and everything we do is meaningless and the Greatest of humans who gave lives for our country all r meaningless (and I don't think u think so).

I know plenty of people who are sick, ill, broken individuals barely keeping their lives together and the idea of an afterlife or higher presence puts them at ease.

As long as there are bad people, acts of hate and crime will forever exist. Some people need a beleif in a higher power to help justify a reason to be good, a reason not to murder or steal.

Until today I will never understand why people cannot live and let live because everybody is allowed to believe in what they want and also to practice what they want.

Religions have a personal meaning for every human being and this should be accepted because it is also okay if you think that there is no God and you just want to talk yourself into believing that there is no God. This is also your own opinion which you should keep for yourself and not try to convince everyone as the right one. Although what seems to be right for you doesn't have to be so for the other person. In my opinion a religion serves the people not only to form something beautiful after death - there is much more to it. If you believe there is no God then you feel this personally and you don't have to shout that all this is stupid and nonsense.

It is part of human instinct, when realising as a human how small and helpless we often are, to believe that some super force exists way beyond our understanding and comprehension. It's not about the fear of concept of death but actually the hardship and pain in this life that let us to seek comfort and rest in believing something better for us is at the hands of someone beyond our control. And i dont think a world without religion would be a much better, more peaceful world than a world with religions. Too much violence in the name of religion is actually due to the fact that religion is used as a political weapon, to wipe out enemy races, to conquer lands, to overthrow empires, to rise against common enemies etc.

You may say go talk to a therapist if you need help,but how effective was that. Have all ppl enjoy their life's and get freed from depression after their therapy? I don't think so. Only some minds get carried away by beliefs and radicalise everything in the name of religion. But that number is less. Some ppl see it as a purpose of life and do good things also in their life in the name of religion. so to conclude,let people believe whatever they want unless it affects our society.

I think you’re forgetting about the most terrifying prospect imaginable - an eternity of torment separated from God and the possibility of relief from suffering. I suppose many religious believers begin their spiritual journey preferring total annihilation after death to a belief system like Christianity that allows for such a horrific potentially.

The fact of the matter is that you know that God exists. You simply do not wish to accept him on his terms. You want your sin more than the truth, so you rage against God and all who follow him (however imperfectly) hoping you find comfort in likeminded individuals, of which you’ll find plenty on reddit.

That said, we’re all sinners in need of forgiveness, and it’s never too late for a living person to ask Jesus Christ to open their eyes to the truth of his gospel. There is a way to escape God’s judgment, and it is in the person of his son, Jesus Christ, who lived the perfect life you and I could not, went to the cross and died as a substitute sufferer of God’s wrath that you and I deserve, and who rose from the dead, having satisfied God’s wrath against the sin of all who put their faith in him and submit to him as Lord.

fitb80k,"How Avicenna ‘prove’ God/Allah/Bhagwan exists

“The full argument is a bit complicated, but here is a somewhat simplified version. Avicenna’s proof actually has nothing to do with design, he doesn’t need the idea that the universe is intelligently put together. Instead, he argues from the idea that the things we see around us are ‘contingent’ or merely ‘possible’.

“The idea here is that a contingent thing is something that may either exist or not exist; its nature does not guarantee that it exists. What Avicenna wants to do is show you that although all the things we experience directly are indeed contingent, there is also something else that exists necessarily, in other words, whose very nature guarantees that it exists.


“To do this, Avicenna points out that since a contingent thing on its own merit could either exist or not exist, it must have some external cause that made it exist - like ‘tipping the scales’ in favor of its existence rather than its non-existence.


“So take me, for instance. I am contingent, meaning that I am the sort of thing that could easily have failed to exist. In fact, at one time I didn’t yet exist, and in the future I will cease existing, that proves I’m not necessary.

“So there must have been a cause, maybe my parents, who brought me into existence. Now Avicenna observes that the aggregate whole of all contingent things – in other words the physical universe – is also contingent. After all, everything in the universe is contingent, so taken all together as one thing, it too must be contingent. Thus it also needs an external cause, just like I do.

“Since that external cause has to be outside the whole aggregate of contingent things, it cannot itself be contingent. So it is necessary. Hey presto, we’ve proven that there is a necessary existent which causes all other things! And this, of course, is God.",-2,0,1582713081.0,BlazingSid,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

The most deadly weapon that religion has in the modern world is childhood indoctrination.

We lable people who take free will away from others a evil, why does that stop applying when God comes up? 

Imagine a world where if you simply didn't have the choice to choose? 
The simplest way to remove evil from this world is to prevent anyone from committing evil. 

Sure that sounds fun at first, perfect even. Think of it this way though, you wouldn't have a choice. No one could lie, cheat, steal, murder, rape, ect. You could even remove natural evils, like sickness, aging, finite resources, ect. 

It'd be a world free of pain, 
A world without hardship or challenge, 
A world without struggle or conflict

In a world without good and evil, humans simply don't exist. We need pain as much as pleasure, we need obstacles as much as relief, and we need the ability to choose.

You can be able and willing to have capital punishment for evilest person in the world, but there're people who believe that shouldn't be done for however minuscule maybe a human has a intrinsic worth. 

I think religion is made to deal with tragedies of life, and it's observations about humans and what human behaviour is best conducive to a good life. It's more about how a human being should act that's at stake in people's minds. I think, that's behind such tendency for such tyranny, that won't leave with religion, because value system will always exists as long as humans exist.

“God,” or whatever you want to call it, is actually infinite. Everything that exists in these finite dimensions of time and space is an eventuality of that infinite domain. In other words, everything that can happen does happen somewhere, eventually. Even events that are perceived by some to be “evil.”

fiun0hw,"Religion is not the source of all evil, it is a convenient excuse to do evil things. The Popes that went on crusades didn't do it for religious reasons, they did it for profit. Evil stems from intense delusion, and often times in history, people have transformed Religion into such a tool.

When you say religion is evil, you must also consider the good it has done. Isaac Newton spent more of his time on Theology than on Natural Philosophy and even then it is clear as day that his natural philosophy had religious influence. The same can be said about many great scientists including people like Oersted (obsession with perfection) and many others.

Conclusion: Religion is a tool that can be easily transformed to justify evil actions for personal gain. Religion has also been a major influence for scientific influence and for a lot of good in the world. Does that mean that atrocities done in the name of religion are good? Of course not, but the argument being made here is that a tool (religion) has both good and bad uses. Just as nuclear fission can be used to make nukes, it can also be used to make power plants.

In its barest definition, religion can be thought of as nothing but the belief in a system with intense devotion. In that sense, almost every economic, political and social theory propounded by anyone can be considered as religious in its nature. Capitalism, communism, consumerism, etc. The OP's points can be applied to all of these, and he would neither be wrong nor right. All these ideologies have killed countless people, wrecked calamitous ruin on a large scale; yet people have faith in these varying ideologies because, that's just what we do.
Even democracy wouldn't have been born without the French Revolution in all it's violent glory.

""Humanity would have one less problem if religion vanished."" 
No, it wouldn't, something else would replace it and I can bet my entire life that it will cause damage on levels easily comparable to that caused by religions. Because religion, just like every other societal practice, is an inherent tendency of human beings to develop. For better or for worse, it's here to stay.

fit8ypb,"Religion by definition is the belief in a god. By god, we mean an extremely powerful being(s) who are responsible for the creation of the world. You have extended it further in your counter argument and said that it also refers to associated culture and behaviour.

Atheism is the lack of such a belief and hence is not an ideal culture or belief system. It is simply the absence of a preconceived one, to repeat myself.

Next, the authors age should not have any importance here, as age does not immediately invalidate an opinion.

Thirdly, how is religion wisdom? Those are two different things in this modern age. Perhaps you could argue that religion is a value system, however it is not the only form of value system. Many have been derived over the years which are divorced from religious ideology.

Perhaps not all humans are the same, but it is our duty to try to be inclusive. Religion however is quite inherently exclusive, splitting people into *them* and *us*.

The very reason you are able to type this post out was due to science and technology. Science is a tool, it is no more responsible for “the atrocities” than the knife that was used to commit a murder. However, many facets of most religious ideologies espouse *protection*.

I personally only have experience with Islam, since that is the religion I was born into, and I can testify that there were holy wars fought because god said those disbelievers were immoral, to paraphrase.

I will agree with you on the fact that religion does not necessarily imply destruction of hard work or whatever.

Atheism is not a term that binds people together. When someone who is non-religious commits an atrocity, there is nothing to connect it to atheism, since one cannot commit an action in the name of nothing. A person who does do this, let’s say,does it with the belief that atheism is necessary (like Mao Zedong), which is by definition, not atheism.

-Stalin and Lenin instituted atheism to suppress free thought, but it wasn't modern atheism. It was more ""you can't believe this stuff so you can focus on your work and not be motivated to try and rebel""

-Stalin was fucked in his own special way 

-Hitler actually _encouraged_ his men to be religious.

Even if your thick headed statement were true, there are plenty of examples of Christian's, Hindu, Muslim, etc killing for their religon.

HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE CRUSADES?

Also Martin Luther, the ""father of modern Protestantism"" was a raving anti-Semitic who inspired Hitler to use the Jews as scapegoats.

fsnsd6p,"I see where you're coming from. But maybe try looking it from a different POV.

""Aren’t you making a religion of yours? I have atheist friends and I am talking from personal experience where they sit n preach atheist stuff and try to influence others."" Well does your personal experience entail hearing them out, or merely looking at their views and deriving a conclusion that they are 'preaching or influencing' others? Have you ever tried approaching them and asking them questions about it because more often than not people don't! They like to look and judge and rant but not engage in a conversation or exchange ideas! In the world full of constant noise of religious bickery, muffled voices of atheists can barely be heard, so yes sometimes it's possible that some of them would try to scream their lungs out! But is that wrong? To want to be heard? How is that 'influencing' exactly?

You think of it as a cult. How is it a cult when logical ideas are discussed without any authoritative idol figure?! You are saying that there are no strict rules to be followed in any religion and you very well know how wrong you are here. Religion is all about those rules that people make and follow. Those subtle subtexts and unwritten commandments that people follow. If you are flexible with those rules then it your personal take on your faith. Please do not project that on the religion. Religions has always been about those written and unwritten rules. 

I also understand why you'd use the phrase ""Hindu and still an atheist."" Which is because someone at some point in the past decided to come up with the inclusion! ""Hey guys let's also include atheists within our religion and call them nastiks oh how cool are we!"" And I get it, Hinduism is more about ways of living a life and less about imposing rules, but think about it, it's all a wordplay really. It's like people selling you this really great image of a brand even when it's broken. It's just good PR. And before you get offended, realize that it's just an analogy to let you see a different perspective. Maybe, what your individual faith wants to touch upon is spirituality, but religion isn't the same as being spiritual. They both are different things and you know it within your heart! You can try and mix them both but they'll always be different.

When you say you're not a strict religious person, what you actually mean is you do not practice certain norms which are practiced by several others in your religion. You feel that it brings a certain sense of independence and how cool your religion is where people can have such an independence and oh how inclusive your religion is, that people can actually be nastiks and still be a part of. That sense of independence is again, systematic brain washing. What if you are conditioned to think that your religion is well adjusted. You can cite all you want about how easy going it is, but something that invokes this sense of prejudice, aggression and possessiveness can't actually be that well adjusted. There are other religions like Buddhism which are more laid back. Before you throw an argument like Buddhism has roots in Hinduism, ask yourself doesn't every religion have roots somewhere or the other. And all can be traced back to a civilization who once started worshiping elements of nature. That is what religion basically boils down to. Something people follow to make themselves feel safe. And it would have been okay if it was limited to that. But soon it manifested into many things including paranoia and people start becoming more defensive and aggressive towards other communities and now we're here. A world gone to shit. The world could use lack of faith on non existent elements and more faith in humanity. And yes religion tries to teach humanity as well, but it's not a requirement! Humanity doesn't have to rely on religion to be practiced. Which is why atheists exists. You can't call every exchange of ideas as ""preaching"". The bashing that is done by atheists has a solid reasoning as well. Understand that before getting defensive.",2,1,1591122110.0,,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

Ironically, it was reading the Bible cover to cover that lead me away from Christianity and into a more neutral way of believing. I don’t know that I would say I am truly an atheist...I don’t discount the possibility of a being or beings that are of higher intellect and ability than humans. But I don’t subscribe to a particular way of interpreting that possibility. I see religion for what it is...a man made tool used to dominate and control the masses by generating a fear based belief system. I have studied many religions and I am fascinated by learning about different cultures and religions because it gives me insight into the way people around the world live their lives. I use this knowledge to answer questions my children pose about different faiths. 

We live in the Bible Belt in the US, so my children are constantly bombarded with “Christian ideals” from their friends. But my children have been taught so much about religions that they are easily able to counter their friends’ rhetoric. In fact, most of the time, my children know more about their friends’ religions than their friends do! But it’s approached from an analytical perspective, not blind faith. They make their friends question their own beliefs using logic and knowledge. It makes me very proud, but it still saddens me when my children are told by their friends that they are “going to hell” for not being Christians.

We have told all our children “You have the right to believe whatever you want. If your faith gives you peace and makes you a better person, then we support you. If you use faith/religion as an excuse to bad things to other people, then we do NOT support that.” We follow that with telling them to wait until you’re an adult before you decide IF you want to follow a religion. We are also supportive of NO religion. My 14 year old has already declared himself an atheist. Sometimes my other two children (who do believe in *some kind* of life after death) will try to come down on the one who is an atheist. I am very quick to point out that he has as much right to believe what makes sense to him as they do to believe in life after death...and I point out that them coming down on their brother is the same as their friends telling them they’re going to hell. That’s usually enough common sense to get them to self-regulate. 

We support love in our family. We have taught our children to NOT see race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation as a roadblock to love.

fiucopb,"Gobekli Tepe . It is a mistake to say religion is the MAIN cause of conflict in the world, and to OPs assumption that humans could never live peacfuly without it, I would like to share the dicovery of Gobekli Tepe.

Around11,000 years ago, before the advent of farming, Gobekli Tepe was created by a tribes of hunter gathers in turkey.

This means that “civilization” existed before humans had the ability to farm, it was calculated that at least 500 people were needed to creat this stone structure, one of the heaviest pillars weighing more than 50 tons.

The point here is that, by whatever belief, these people were able to peaceful cooperate and create a engineering marvel in a time before humans knew what war was.

They also had to have an abundance of food before farming.

There are carvings of buffalo and other animals among the stone pillars, so the environment was much more green. 

It is theorized that because of farming, and the practice of tilling, that the people, after abandoning the ways of the hunter gatherer, began to till the earth and created a dust bowl similar to the american mid west of centuries of farming this way. 

Science is always evolving, but progress is never always for the benefit for mankind, farming was a means to an end.

The cause of war is not religion, but the military, which is its own religion in itself. 

How did the church ever have any real power? It is nothing but a fantastical idea, so much as a government or any other nationalistic, racist ideology.

The power is with those with the physical tools to wield it, no book could compel a man to give up his land, unless there be a physical threat to make him do so.

The crusaders did not kill with their words and scripture, but with metal.

It is nothing but another excuse to kill, no difference in what you call it.


Addressing your OPs belief that there is nothing but void and darkness after you die, in the world of newtonian physics you are correct, a world of observable phenomenon quantifiable through detection of materiel means.

Since Relativity, we have discovered that the world is not all physical, and that matter is indeed just another form of energy, with this in mind, what evidence do you have to prove that consciousness is not another form of energy?

A form of energy that can travel as a wave or a particle, much like light.

If this is so, and it is not only a complex synapses of neurons perceiving  our environment through sensory stimuli, it would suggest that this energy, like all energies, would simply change from.

A biological example is our dna, which is a memory of billions of years of sense perceived by different bodies, stored in the form of double helix proteins, This memory is a another change in form of us as biologicals, and everything we have perceived physical will also be recorded by this primordial code, and if so, conciseness is a part of this code, as it has developed a neural network to facilitate such, then it to would be passed on thorough genetic exchange.

The problem is that this code has developed for the biological world, not a technological world, and as such, it will respond to technological one adversely, the change of diet that started with  farming, disrupting the communities of billions of bacteria and neurons residing in our stomach, now replaced by simple grains and ill bred cattle.

This can lead to a neurological and physiological change as much as it did when we began to cook our good and eat more diverse foods as hunter gathers.

To the work we did, from days of community hunts and and social gatherings, to hard and stress full days of toiling and tilling earth.

 Finally the ultimate stress of not being able to feed yourself do to famine, and the threat of others of your own species who posses new weapons of war, through metallurgy.

No where in any of this was religion a problem, it is only another ideological way to justify the killing of others to benefit the self, (no different than capitalism, communism, facism, and any other idea that lives off the exploitation, coercion of others. Also by means of subliminal propaganda. ) and this only occurred on large scales after humans created an environment when such practices were deemed necessary for surrival.

The last example I can give here is the example of the equilibrium the natives of the Americas had reached with their environment, vs our industrial world view and way of life.

-pleas note that the use of the word “white man is as indicative to the time this was written as the word “indian”.-

“The Indian was a natural conservationist. He destroyed nothing, great or small. Destruction was not a part of Indian thought and action; if it had been, and had the man been the ruthless savage he has been acredited with being, he would have long ago preceded the European in the labor of destroying the natural life of this continent. 

The Indian was frugal in the midst of plenty. When the buffalo roamed the plains in multitudes he slaughtered only what he could eat and these he used to the hair and bones. 

Early one spring the Lakotas were camped on the Missouri river when the ice was beginning to break up. One day a buffalo floated by and it was hauled ashore. The animal proved to have been freshly killed and in good condition, a welcome occurrence at the time since the meat supply was getting low. 

Soon another came floating downstream, and it was no more than ashore when others came into view. Everybody was busy saving meat and hides, but in a short while the buffalo were so thick on the water that they were allowed to float away. Just why so many buffalo had been drowned was never known, but I relate the instance as a boyhood memory.

I know of no species of plant, bird, or animal that were exterminated until the coming of the white man. For some years after the buffalo disappeared there still remained huge herds of antelope, but the hunter’s work was no sooner done in the destruction of the buffalo than his attention was attracted toward the deer. They are plentiful now only where protected. 

The white man considered natural animal life just as he did the natural man life upon this continent, as ‘pests.’ Plants which the Indian found beneficial were also ‘pests.’ There is no word in the Lakota vocabulary with the English meaning of this word.

There was a great difference in the attitude taken by the Indian and the Caucasian toward nature, and this difference made of one a conservationist and of the other a non-conservationist of life. 

The Indian, as well as all other creatures that were given birth and grew, were sustained by the common mother—earth. He was therefore kin to all living things and he gave to all creatures equal rights with himself. Everything of earth was loved and reverenced. 

The philosophy of the Caucasian was, ‘Things of the earth, earthy’—to be belittled and despised. Bestowing upon himself the position and title of a superior creature, others in the scheme were, in the natural order of things, of inferior position and title; and this attitude dominated his actions toward all things. 

The worth and right to live were his, thus he heartlessly destroyed. Forests were mowed down, the buffalo exterminated, the beaver driven to extinction and his wonderfully constructed dams dynamited, allowing flood waters to wreak further havoc, and the very birds of the air silenced. 


Great grassy plains that sweetened the air have been upturned; springs, streams, and lakes that lived no longer ago than my boyhood have dried, and a whole people harassed to degradation and death. The white man has come to be the symbol of extinction for all things natural to this continent. “

I am not arguing for life after death, nor did I tell you to pick a religion that includes that belief. I didn't suggest that you believe in heaven, hell, purgatory, reincarnation, or a red pill/blue pill choice to escape a ""simulation."" You miss my point. I am not advocating religion, I am advocating informed critical thought. It feels to me like you have a strong emotional response to my suggestion. That's fine--great, actually. We should care about these things.

You presuppose that there is no existence beyond ""this one,"" without evidence. A scientist cannot test a hypothesis in the absence of evidence, and declaring a conclusion in the absence of testing is unscientific.

I get it that you are strongly opposed to religion. I get that. I really do. It's easy to find dozens of atrocities carried out in the name of one religion or another. Beyond that, you've missed what I was asking:

  * WHY is religion so ubiquitous? Some cognitive neuroscientists believe that religions modes of thought, and theism may have strong, physiological underpinnings. We may be hardwired (so to speak) to model the world in certain ways, and cope with the unknown in certain ways.

  * Why is religion so intensely, profoundly impactful and important for so many people? Could it be that it helps fill certain human needs?

  * Why are you so threatened by religious thought?

  * Is religious belief inherently in opposition to the scientific method?

Sorry you feel that way. I feel I haven't made myself clear, though that's partly because I believe it's often preferable to show someone a door, and leave the exploration of what's beyond to them. If I tell you a particular politician is horrible, corrupt, and dangerous, you might believe me, if you regarded me as trustworthy. If suggest that you read a few factually well-supported, well-researched articles a week about that politician, you will come to your own, far more powerful understanding.

The argument, ""religion is bad and stupid, and everyone who believes in one is bad and stupid"" doesn't get anyone anywhere. it is not a critical examination, it is exactly the sort of hand-waving which organized religions use to criticize all external or incongruent modes of thought.

> Pretty much everything you just said is completely stupid.

Whew. OK. Let me put it more plainly. Growth of anything--knowledge, understanding--whatever-- relies fundamentally on one thing: change. If you are incapable or unwilling to subject your own beliefs to the scrutiny of methodical, scientific inquiry, you will not grow. Your thinking will not grow, your knowledge will not grow, your understanding will not grow. If you want to create a subreddit where everyone sits around telling each other how right you all are that religious is dumb and bad and stupid, then go crazy. Have fun. It isn't meaningful, though. It's just mental masturbation. You aren't asking questions, you aren't attempting to learn anything, you've just created a safe-space for being right. While you're at it, why not cement the door closed with a complete ban on any statements suggesting of religious thought? There's nothing more orderly than a hermetic order!

> leaving your faith and coming back to the real world.

Wow. Can you imagine *any* belief that you hold, which someone else might possibly change by telling you to abandon your faith in it, and to come back to the real world? Is that really what you're after, to get poor, deluded religious people to flee their faith, and come back to the real world? Pretty much every cognitive neuroscientist I've read after the 1960s has put forth some version of the idea that there really, truly ISN'T a ""real world."" We live in a bit of a consensual hallucination, and there are a shit-ton of ways that that's been demonstrated clinically. I recommend starting down that path of inquiry by reading things like *[The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Mistook_His_Wife_for_a_Hat)* by Oliver Sacks, *[Consciousness Explained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_Explained)* by Dennett, maybe Stephen Pinker's *[The Language Instinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_Instinct)*, and *[How the Mind Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_Mind_Works)*. Definitely my dad's favorite: [Stephen Jay Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould).

Have you read guys like Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins? They could really help you up your anti-religious game.

Yelling at the world to stop being as it is... is kind of a bit silly, isn't it? Being ""on the side of science"" isn't a free pass to exclude any information which you deem to be ""unscientific.""  If you aren't willing to pursue contact or understanding of modes of thought you've already decided are bad and wrong, but you are willing to tell other people that they're beliefs are wrong, isn't that proselytizing? If you want to wave the banner of science, you must hold yourself to the same standards which form the basis of the scientific method.

I will explain the Hanafi law, as I don't know the other ones. Basically, marriage is legal at any age. So, yes, child marriages are allowed. However, sexual intercource between the husband and the wife happens after the girl reaches puberty, not before.

Source: A website which belongs to Hanafi scholars:

Definition of pedophilia and Islam

According to the dictionary.com, pedophilia is defined as the ""sexual desire in an adult for a child"". According to Islam, a child is somebody who has not reached puberty yet. So even if a girl is nine years old; she is not (Islamically) considered a child if she has reached the age of puberty. Thus, if a man engages in sexual intercourse with her, it is not considered pedophilia...because the girl is not a child to begin with. It doesn't fit the definition of pedophilia.

""This question is put up because, many non believers are in a notion of this, and imagine if someone asks you, and you could not answer.""

Nowadays in the United States a girl at the age of 18 is considered an adult. So if she marries, let's say, a 40 year old; it will not be considered pedophilia. But what if, say 100 years later, the United States changes its definition of adulthood from 18 to 20? Then will this 40 year old guy who married an 18 year old today, be considered a pedophile 100 years later??

In other words, if a nonbeliever accuses the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) of pedophilia, then ask them if their definition of adulthood is better than that of other people. If so, then why? Why should the age of adulthood be considered 18 and not anything else?",1,2,1582789512.0,54mi,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

fiuxu1s,"The flaw with the trilemma is that it assumes God isn't doing something. We may not like an outcome or an event, but we don't understand them from the same perspective. Additionally, imagine using a similar argument of ""Why have police or courts if they don't prevent crime or punish every crime?"" The job of both is to bring justice, not prevent crime itself. You can guide people away from crime, but short of the greater evil of controlling people's lives, you can only punish criminals. Ergo, the evil you see is the result of free will which, again, it is a greater evil to nix free will altogether.

 As far as Christianity is concerned there is punishment for unrepentant evil. It may not come as swiftly as YOU like, but it comes regardless. 

Additionally, nature in and of itself is not evil. Things evolved to fit their places in an ecosystem. A parasite is no more evil than a dog or a mouse ,it simply fulfills its role; namely to reproduce its genetic material. The destruction or pain it causes may not be pleasant, but those things are temporary anyway. 

Lastly, you live in a time where you have far less of a connection to the natural world around you than people who came before. Your ability to experience the world has been hampered by technology that, while it provides some great comforts, has disconnected you from a greater reality. If you took the time to explore religions properly you might learn how the psychedelics in their respective areas formed their religions. (Edit: I didn't mean this to come off as accusatory, but just that there's a lot of depth we don't normally explore. It took me years as an atheist to finally find that there was a natural foundation for the major world religions) A god capable of forming this universe is capable of slowly guiding natural processes and evolution to prove its existence through tools available to us. 

Nature and God aren't at odds and only fools argue that science disproves God or that creation myths disprove science.

Or that it has to be read in its original language to understand it's true meaning. This is all bullshit and religion will never provide us anything but a placebo.

fiujtzj,"China cracked down on Christianity in the name of power and authority, not atheism. 

Researchers say the current drive, fuelled by government unease over the growing number of Christians and their potential links to the west, is aimed not so much at destroying Christianity but bringing it to heel.

>“The government has orchestrated a campaign to ‘sinicise’ Christianity, to turn Christianity into a fully domesticated religion that would do the bidding of the party,” said Lian Xi, a professor at Duke University in North Carolina, who focuses on Christianity in modern China.

>“The goal of the crackdown is not to eradicate religions,” said Ying Fuk Tsang, director of the Christian Study Centre on Chinese Religion and Culture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “President Xi Jinping is trying to establish a new order on religion, suppressing its blistering development. [The government] aims to regulate the ‘religious market’ as a whole.”

>While the CCP is officially atheist, Protestantism and Catholicism are two of five faiths sanctioned by the government and religious freedom has been enshrined in the constitution since the 1980s. For decades, authorities tolerated the house churches, which refused to register with government bodies that required church leaders to adapt teachings to follow party doctrine.

You didn't even read the article. The Chinese government is afraid of Western religions and their influence because it detracts from their authoritarian rule. 

>“Ten years ago, we used to be able to say the party was not really interested in what people believed internally,” said Pils. “Xi Jinping’s response is much more invasive and it is in some ways returning to Mao-era attempts to control hearts and minds.”

That is highly untrue...

America came into being by taking over land occupied by the native Americans...killed them off systematically....and forced the rest on to reservations. They slowly rotting/dying off in their confined land jails. 

The land was worked using salves, the wealth from the stolen land and the salves helped modernize/industrialize the country

Two world wars left the most of the world bombed to hell but left America unaffected physically. 

Americans figured out they can con the world via non-gold backed fiat currency by claiming their economy is strong and their money is valuable (forced the word to trade oil/gold using the dollar)

Dollar being valued high helps America purchase raw materials cheaply 

Bombed/threaten anyone who questioned the value of the dollar (Saddam, Qaddafi, Iran, Syria) 

Put murderous dictators in power that killed millions to ensure their regional hegemony is maintained 

Supports Israel to appease American fanatical fundamentalist Christians 

Actively promotes American form of fanatical fundamentalist Christianity world wide to create unrest

fittj59,"I’m from the US for context.  

This country being a flag bearer for democracy is smoke and mirrors.  It’s all about wealth, power, and maintaining the hegemony.  It’s not a reflection of the American people, it’s a reflection of what’s effectively a capitalism based oligarchy where wealth is leveraged as influence, but it avoids the notoriety of other countries because the players change so much.  

Look for the “why” if you see the US intervention.  Some company will all of the sudden gain drilling rights for oil.  Some economic windfall always seems to mysteriously follow.... 

While I’m not fluent in every single military campaign, though I did serve in the US military, the last “Honorable” intervention I can think of was Mogadishu and that was 25 years ago.  

The biggest winners are always the “Military-industrial complex”. No one profits from war more than the arms dealers, and whether they’re officially condoned or not the Boeings and Lockheed Martins of the world are arms dealers.  The us military has 7 prime contractors, I work for a subdivision of one of them, those 7 companies have just shy of 600,000 employees.  All of them fighting for their piece of the Department of Defense’s $750,000,000,000 (750 billion dollars) annual budget.

fiw3wfe,"Imagine being a parent (if you are then, yeah). You want what's best for your child but you know that doing everything for them turns to over reliance. The best you can do is try to instruct them on how to act so that they can handle problems themselves. Atheists tend to think that in order for God to exist he must interact directly and conspicuously, but that's not the best solution to the problem. In the Dao philosophy, paraphrasing, ""the best leader is the one who, when all is said and done, his people will say 'we have done this ourselves!'"" 

God doesn't need to interact with you for him to exist. You can take for granted that billions of people are on this planet, all of whom have some degree of impact on your life, and yet you'll say ""I cannot see the influence of God, therefore he doesn't exist"" as if those two thoughts don't compete.

There's a misunderstanding about forgiveness/permission. If you read what Jesus said his underlying philosophy is that God understands people are human, subject to irrational thought and actions, and that we all fuck up from time to time. The point is that so long as you're sorry and make an attempt to improve you'll be forgiven. The gospels answer any retort you might have, but more succinctly; God, like a parent, doesn't seek to punish his children obtusely, but disciplining your child is still required for growth and maturity. Punishment in the face of willful disobedience is necessary, and our entire justice system is hinged upon the same thought. You curb bad behavior with consequences or else people will continue to act poorly. 

I suppose you take any form of consequence as a harmful act, but then are you not willfully misbehaving? You want to do as you please, but you don't want repercussions? What does that make you? If you behave and address your mistakes, what fear do you need to have of consequences? If you misbehave and are upset when you're punished, you've learned nothing.

I said ""Nature, in and of itself, is not evil."" Sin exists, crime exists. Both are interchangeable terms at their core -- they are acts which offend either your own wellbeing or society's wellbeing. My argument is that you cannot point to a hurricane or an earthquake and say, ""these are evil things!"" They are events. They may result in death, but if there is life after then what is death here? You cannot point to a virus that kills its host and say ""This virus is evil!"" It's simply doing what it does the way all things follow their nature.

But you. You are separate from nature. You have a will and you exercise it. You choose, whether rationally or not, how you will act and how you will react. You understand consequence and are capable of reason in ways animals, plants, and natural forces cannot. You, and everyone else, decide how you will love and who you will hurt, not God. Everyone controls their own actions and you cannot say ""Tom slapped Jane because Barry didn't stop him!"" It is not Barry's responsibility to manage Tom's actions no more than it is God's to manage yours or a government's.

Lastly, God has given you tools to understand him. It is up to you to use them. Either God guided natural processes to give us these tools, or a godless universe created chemicals through a fluke of evolution to give us the impression gods exist. The latter is absurd because one such event could be a fluke, but many? Besides, for all we've learned about our universe, it is an act of extreme arrogance to say our limited scope of reason can definitively say we are in a war against a heartless universe.

Now I don't know the exact situation you were in because I'm not you, From what you descirbed, your teacher was forcing their ideology on you and weren't even attempting to give a full picture about the effects that religion has on people. But that blanket statement is implying that there hasn't been an atheist scientist that basically had a massive freakout and turned to religion to satisfy their logical needs and to soothe themselves..

Of course, if you value your life and your future, believing in religion in your last moments is not going to completely get rid of your anxiety. It won't change the fact that everything you're looking forward to is about to be taken away. Von Neuman turned to religion when his time was short for a reason. If it truly brought him no consolation or any logical satisfaction to what happens to him when he dies, he wouldn't have turned to it in the first place. Especially when doing so contradicts so much of what he believed throughout his life.

I replied to your comment because I think that you're only seeing the bad side of religion. Religion has been used for many bad things. It has been used countless times to control others for power. It has been used as a justification to commit what is undoubtedly immoral. It has been used to control thinking. But religion has also done a lot of positive things too. It has united people in suffering. It has inspired some of the greatest art. It has conveyed great moral messages for people across generations. It has inspired some of the greatest scientists of all time including Newton, Oersted, Maxwell, Kelvin,  the list is tremendous. So has religion been used for evil? Absolutely.

fitbt49,"I don't think you are understanding my comment. I'm focussing here on the daily life of an average atheist versus a religiously inspired person, in absence of all other factors like money or advertising or stuff like that. It's a theoretical framework I'm setting up here - don't get too diverted by the Teresa example.

I'm sure a lot of good people happen to be atheists. I'm sure some of them are also doing  good for others, not particularly driven by any atheist ideals. 

But there are a lot more atheists who may be good people but are just living their own lives and going about their jobs or business. They are not necessarily doing anything especially good for society other than the minimum that law and society expect of them. The best thing we can say about them is that they are not doing anything bad to society. But nothing in the philosophy or ideas of atheism inspires them to go beyond their own lives in service of others. 

Organized religions are a bit different. Sure they inspire many, probably most, towards great evil. There are also the average religious people who are also just going about their own lives and not doing anything particularly bad, just like the average atheist. 
But there is a 3rd group that is unique to religion. Religious ideals seem to inspire some of these otherwise average people towards going beyond their own lives and self-interests and sacrificing their comforts to make those of others better. I used Teresa merely as a well-known example. But all religions have some kind of charities, poverty programmes, meals schemes, free education, healthcare facilities and so on. And these otherwise average religious people take the initiative to set them up or fund or maintain them, driven mainly by religious ideals. 

Now the question is - if religion did not exist, would all such average people still take up such initiatives that make others' lives better for no particular reason other than being good as an end in itself? If it were so, we should logically expect a lot more average people, maybe even a majority of people, to be doing much more than living their own lives, their own jobs, their own self-interests in our world. Since we don't observe this high proportion among the average atheists or average religious people, my hypothesis is that it is religion that inspires some and therefore adds some benefits to society that absence of religion does not. 

It is possible to argue that religion does more harm than good and so net benefit is negative but that is not mutually exclusive of my hypothesis about inspirational aspect of religions.",2,5,1582713858.0,,1582714150.0,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

You can blather on all day about how war is preordained in human history, and you will find me agreeing on many of these points. Humans are a divided species that hold strong opinions, and will fight over them. It's what we do. 


#HOWEVER


The _motives_ for our species in-fighting are often different. One motive is, of course religion. Religion is an opinion, no? Humans fight over opinions. Therefore... you make the connection. Not only that, but the fact that there are so many religions divided among so many ethnic groups means that... well... they fight. They disagree and fight. Sure, humans fight all the time, but religion has a talent of polarizing people because one religion inherently rejects the rest. (I'm sure you're going to come up with some obscure religion that doesn't do this, but I'm talking about the 99.9%) It's just how religion is. It's another (frankly unnecessary) facet of human culture, and it's such an antiquated, yet incorporated, part of us.

All religions start as a way to explain death. Everything else is added after. 

Humans seek answers and religion is their to provide comfort. A noble effort corrupted by dogma and men seeking power (and sex/ownership of women). 

No atheist I have ever met or talked to has advocated for regulation of religions (except when it comes to causing harm etc) most just want people to be free to think critically and break the shackles of a childhood of propaganda. 

People can believe and say what they want. I am also free to tell them they are wrong. 

Your correct in saying that Stalin Mao wtc were atheist. (Hitler was actually a Christian and all Nazis had Christian teachings etched onto blades etc so to say they were atheist is just false)

But what they were not is advocates of free though and critical thinking. They simply replaced ancient dogma with state dogma of their own effectively creating state religions. 

Religion may not drive leaders to genocide (in some cases it absolutely does) but it allows them to justify their actions and motivate their more naive underlings.

It's important to remember even as an atheist, that atheism is not a belief system it's a lack of one. A neutral position. Stalin also didn't believe in fairies but you wouldn't blame his atrocities on that.

Ok, your argument seems alright upto to a certain point then there's the question to ask, is there nothing other than religion that inspires people to get up and do good?



Think of it like this, taking your own analogy here, aren't there any organisations that set up charities,poverty programmes, meals schemes, free education, healthcare facilities and so on? And aren't there people going above and beyond their power to do good without taking inspiration from religion?Ok, i had to Google this but here's it Annie Laurie Gaylor, here's an atheist that fights for human rights of women. What inspired her to do that?



So atheists not donate to charity, apparently according to a study they do. But mostly to secular charities and giving to the church is not counted.



When the founders of democracy, communism or socialism prescribed their ideas, they vehemently wanted the separation of the church and the state. These so called atheists strived and gave their lives so that people irrespective of their religion could live better lives.




>If it were so, we should logically expect a lot more average people, maybe even a majority of people, to be doing much more than living their own lives, their own jobs, their own self-interests in our world. Since we don't observe this high proportion among the average atheists or average religious people, my hypothesis is that it is religion that inspires some and therefore adds some benefits to society that absence of religion does not. 




Your observation is clearly anecdotal. You see a more atheistic society always seems to have more equality of income and more scientifically sound populous where people don't have to suffer for having an abortion.




I think your point of view is marred by what i call religious propaganda and maybe you've given into it. A world without religion may have been the same or worse or better, but it's not religion that inspires people to do good. Some people are just like that, they stand up, they help.




A religion that first classifies it's followers, then the ones in the upper class helps the underprivileged class because they feel bad by donating but inherently doesn't do anything to solve the issue at hand is just absurd.",2,6,1582718539.0,nonmathew,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
fittoi0,"> But there are a lot more atheists who may be good people but are just living their own lives and going about their jobs or business. They are not necessarily doing anything especially good for society other than the minimum that law and society expect of them. The best thing we can say about them is that they are not doing anything bad to society. But nothing in the philosophy or ideas of atheism inspires them to go beyond their own lives in service of others. 

I take exception to this claim. What basis do you have to claim that atheists are not contributing to social good in the same numbers as theists? That claim stems from a position of mild prejudice, because you are literally assuming that *because* atheists have no religious framework to compel them to contribute to social good, they will choose not to.

I see you make an argument to buttress your claim in the next paragraph:

>Organized religions are a bit different. Sure they inspire many, probably most, towards great evil. There are also the average religious people who are also just going about their own lives and not doing anything particularly bad, just like the average atheist. But there is a 3rd group that is unique to religion. Religious ideals seem to inspire some of these otherwise average people towards going beyond their own lives and self-interests and sacrificing their comforts to make those of others better. I used Teresa merely as a well-known example. But all religions have some kind of charities, poverty programmes, meals schemes, free education, healthcare facilities and so on. And these otherwise average religious people take the initiative to set them up or fund or maintain them, driven mainly by religious ideals. 

So you're saying that atheists who work with secular humanitarian groups/charities are far fewer as a percentage of atheists than there are religiously driven humanitarians (as a percentage of the theists)? What basis do you have to arrive at this claim? Just because you hypothesize a third group which cannot exist in an atheistic population, it doesn't mean that the total percentage of people contributing to social good in either population is lesser or greater in statistically meaningful way. When atheists as a percentage of the population are few and far between, of course you will see far fewer of them partaking in social work.

After which I will point out that your claim about the third group itself is bogus, because you can have ethical and moral values based on secular principles without any kind of religious perspective. In school this can be taught as a part of classes on Civics, or as a separate subject called Personality Development. There are many countries in Europe with a largely non-religious population.

>Now the question is - if religion did not exist, would all such average people still take up such initiatives that make others' lives better for no particular reason other than being good as an end in itself? If it were so, we should logically expect a lot more average people, maybe even a majority of people, to be doing much more than living their own lives, their own jobs, their own self-interests in our world. Since we don't observe this high proportion among the average atheists or average religious people, my hypothesis is that it is religion that inspires some and therefore adds some benefits to society that absence of religion does not. 

You didn't prove that there are fewer atheists (as a percentage of the atheistic population) involved in social work than there are theists (as a percentage of the theistic population) involved in social work. Nor did you prove that there are more atheists (percentage) who go about minding their own business than there are theists minding their own business.

Your claim that a third, religiously motivated group which exists to do social good while an equivalent atheistic group does not exist also does not stand scrutiny because there is no basis for the latter part of your claim. Indeed, I would claim that many religious charities/NGOs do not welcome atheists into their ranks, or that atheists do not find themselves comfortable in working in a group which is religiously motivated. They would rather prefer to work in secular organizations where their religious identity is not at the forefront of their activities.

The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

The other thing humans are very drawn to is to form factions. The fascination to sports, to the concept of nations all stem from this. I mean you would also belong in a way to the faction of atheists.

Yes, you are not going to kill and maim and loot and rape because you're an atheist.

It's a very powerful force that was originally meant to unite people. But world becoming smaller leads to a frantic rondo situation where everyone tramples on everyone's foot.

Now, imagine if all religions ceases to be. Science becomes the absolute paradigm that dictates the world. People would still form factions.

fj0oewp,"Finely tuned I don’t need evidence , I just observe nature and that everything is a reflection of the greater whole.... finely tuned , as in our habitable position and the process that make it sustainable quite simply 

And again - “ According to Hindu vedic cosmology, there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic.[2] Similarly, the space and universe has neither start nor end, rather it is cyclical. The current universe is just the start of a present cycle preceded by an infinite number of universes and to be followed by another infinite number of universes.[3]”

This doesn’t really sound like a religion to me , trust me I have studied most of them , I can affirm the difference between false ideology of biblical plagiarism to what was once quite simple and universal... 

space itself is infinite , there’s just a limit on physical law , but the creation process is very much never ending , everything is cyclic , only in Ignorant arrogance can someone dismiss thousands of years worth of real knowledge  , it’s not anyone’s fault that you don’t understand it but your own...

Poor you for being so dead inside misled , have immature perception regarding tarring all of them under the same orthodox brush , that’s a real blow for you trust me on that .... 

As for shunning just Christianity , no trust me Islamic invasions where playing the same set of conquest cards the roman invasions was driving out the Gnostics like “Muhammad” drove out the Gnostics of Persia , which was the class of Zoroastrianism- you have ways of life , knowledge gained from pure experience observation and experimentation , which Is what a lot of the old mythologies and cosmology were about and they all related across the globe they all correlate , well Atleast they did before the great global take over driven by control capture conspiracy and enslave of the Islamic and roman armies at that time 

The branches leading off the Egyptian , Mayan , Vedic , phonecian , Persian gnosis has been replaced with confusion hatred and division... all religion do is label and divide.... this never use to be the case is all I’m stressing and there does seems to be a conspiracy in removing what once was before.... and age now where information can be acquired much easier than say of the 1990s.... I am clued up trust me and there is no excuse anymore for not having the ability to dig

I’m not doubting science and never have done , but neither have I some of the worlds oldest ways of thinking , the point is atheism doesn’t actually help anything , and at the same time neither does one that has plagiarised holy scripture for its own political agendas

There’s two sides to a coin , we are the result of one side due to the fact there is a mysterious flip side that are actually codependent on eachother and cannot coexist with out 

Inner space manifesting the outer , like I say , I feel Vedic ways of thought and others like it or stemmed from it is more learning toward a metaphysical, quantum understanding , which is equally important , it’s just important how one interprets it and no one in the right mind should be dismissing anything before not be willing to understanding it

⚛️🕉 

I love to use those symbols togther for they represent the near same thing , the om harmonic , it’s also a scientific understanding that sound interacts with atoms and each sun and core galactic sun emits it’s own sound  , as does the living planets , Atman the soul , with out the atom there is no Atman , there’s no creation nor destruction... shiva within the trinity itself  can be seen representative of the atom , and atoms require two charges - Male and female , this is why Male deities always have its female counterpart.... atomic energy and electromagnetism , all requires the same mechanisms - polarity , negative , positive and so on and when there -+ unite they becomes +one-

And whether these operate on an metaphysical archetypal and mechanical deity like level then so be it.... 

See what I’m doing here ? I’m uniting two understanding together because they both work  , because they are with out a doubt ultimately representing the same concepts.. I’m not angrily hastily tarring them off all under the same thing declaring my hatred towards it like this poster is , that won’t get you anywhere..

It started with a sound , that sound is manifesting light and vibrating the atoms into existence ie matter ,  fire  you know Elementis ... that’s a scientific fact , but a fact the Entheogenic Rishis of the Vedas already knew...so for someone as stupid as this poster to be tarring off wisdom of ancient India under the same hate brush is absolutely amazing, it’s amazing because I live in Britain and know more about ancient India and what it has to offer than this here stupid poster does and he’s born and bred.....

You focus on what's here and now but not what's there and later, so of course you think suffering is some gigantic misstep by God. It's your inability to see how one must hunger to enjoy being full.

Soviet Union was a failed construct from the beginning. They tried an economic theory that failed miserably, and its downfall led to modern day Russia.

You should really read up on your history vs. parroting what you read on the internet. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union itself signed the Belaya Vezha accords, dismantling the Soviet Union into its constituent republics. 

The reality was that the Soviet economic model didn't do what it was supposed to, and those countries ended up being economically backward fiefdoms lacking in freedom and basic human rights. So the Baltic and the Caucasus states revolted - from Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia to Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. That resulted in other parts of the Soviet Union joining in, notably Ukraine, Moldova, and even Belarus.

Subsequently, the Warsaw Pact satellite states also left the Union, with Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary joining. Eventually, other nation states like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan also left the Union.

The Soviet Union simply wasn't equipped to unite and fight these revolts (though they tried). Unfortunately, independence meant that the economic system they'd designed no longer worked since different countries produced different things. Infrastructure crashed, and then you had chaos that a few people took advantage of, by buying up shares in public companies in exchange for food.

There is no consensus on the definition of God, from what little I have gathered, the concept of God is fairly complicated in Hinduism when seen with the Karma model.

God is ultimately a model to explain the mysteries of the world, with science we have been able to wrest most of those mysteries from work of God to physical laws in action, but there are still tons of questions that are unanswered, and we don't know where that'll lead us.

January 29, 1907: Charles Curtis becomes the first Native American U.S. Senator.

June 2, 1924: U.S. Congress passes the Indian Citizenship Act, granting citizenship to all Native Americans born in the territorial limits of the country.

I'm familiar with all the arguments and I spouted them for years, they even show up in my facebook and reddit history. But I decided that I had to be intellectually honest with myself and be critical of my own skepticism. 

I started learning *where* religions came from. If you look at the indigenous people of Arizona, Mesoamerica, and Peru, you find that they all used psychedelics in religious practices. Peyote, San Pedro, and Psylocybin mushrooms built their religions. In the Old World the Amanita Muscaria formed the basis for Judaism, Christianity, Taoism, Nordic religions, and surely other more obscure religions. 

My experiences with these cemented a new belief and blew my atheist beliefs away. I have shared an experience that ancient people had, and a thread across time now links them and I. My fiancee and I struggled with infertility for two years, I had a surgery done that showed little progress, so we planned to do IVF. The month before going we had her aviaries checked and saw they were healthy, plus a single follicle. She didnt have PCOS, so we could start the meds she needed to ovulate multiple egges.

I decided that, having already messed with the AM's that I would take some and pray. An atheist praying to something he ""knew"" didn't exist. A man with sperm counts so low (3m sperm instead of the 100m to 200m a healthy man makes) that there really wasn't a chance. We'd tried each month for a year after the surgery to no effect. I prayed for a daughter, easy enough, but as a sort of joke I said to make her hair red because my fiancee hates red hair. She and I were both blonde babies, my hair is dark brown now. Red is so recessive that the odds of the gene expressing with a blonde-ish brunette and and dark brunette is slim, with the only red hair being my biological mother.

In the following days the first and only mushroom to grow in my yard in 4 years at this house showed up. It wasn't Muscaria, but an ersatz recapped one indigenous to Louisiana. Later that same week the blinds in my house turned pink from the daylight outside. I figured itd be a pretty sunset so I stepped outside. All around were pink clouds (I can shared the pictures we have of this), a small patch of blue sky to my left, but above my house a gray cloud was 'descending' towards us. It wasn't coming to the ground, but was like a waterfall of clouds coming down.

A few weeks later the pregnancy test comes back positive. The gender ultrasound showed we were having a girl! Then, when she was born reddish blonde hair grew in. The baby I prayed for was delivered just as ai asked for. The Mushrooms in my yard, the only mushrooms to ever grow on my property to this day, was God saying ""I heard your prayer."" The pink clouds were that she would be a girl. And the red hair was ticking the box.

Since then I gave a friend sensation back in his feet despite the diabetic neuropathy he had for years. Said he felt more than he had on the best days. A friend of mine saw his deceased grandfather when I gave him a handful of muscarias to eat. And I converted another atheist when I explained my thesis and gave him some to try.

There's no realistic argument for atheism left in my mind. Atheists aren't bad people, they're not stupid, either. I was a moral man before, I am a moral man still. I gave what I could to those in need when I was an atheist, and I give to those in need now still. I do good things not to benefit myself, or squirrel away treasures in heaven. I do good because I am grateful to the god who has given me so much. The God that brought me out of an intense suicidal depression and alcoholism that nearly killed me several times. I give back because so much has been given to me, someone who doesn't deserve it.

And honestly, if you chose to do as I had done, you'd understand as I do. If you nod to the universe, it nods back. (Like the time I asked for something simple to give me a good laugh, a few hours later I was pumping gas, saw a dog, smiled at it, and it gave me a big smile back.)

I am interested in discourse, but you're not bringing anything new to the table at all. You're saying what I've heard countless times, trying to make religious texts positive when their overall message is negative.

Take a look at Judaism. What is the message of Torah? Submit to God or die. Do what you are told or die. Is that a good message? 

Now, Christianity. It is based entirely on the idea of original sin, which is stupid (Why should anyone suffer for the crime they didn't commit?) and scapegoating. You can't solve things by putting them on someone else, which is literally what happened to Jesus Christ. 

Islam. Aside from the fact that Mohammed was a pedophile and a warmonger, I don't think I need to add anything. When Islam is weak, it says that it must spread peacefully. When it is strong, however, it demands warfare. 

None of those religions have an overall positive message, and that is exactly why religious atrocities are so well-known. All their ""be good to others"" does not apply to members of other faiths or even denominations that practice the faith wrong. 

If the messages were overall positive, do you really think we'd be in the situation we're in? Do you think that religious extremists who take the word of their holy books would be as violent?

Perhaps you should read about this thing called colonialism much more extensively than the abridged version you were taught in school. Of how *millions* of people laid down their lives around the world so that Europeans (well, mainly Britain, France, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands and to a smaller extent Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Italy etc) could become wealthy.

Most European people who worked for the British East India Company in its heyday came back rather wealthy individuals and formed a part of the upwardly mobile gentry. Scientific racism was actually a thing.

Your level of social progress came partly as a result of World War II, when an extremely ugly side of European society was exposed to the public. Most people couldn't stomach the actions that the Nazi regime took against whom they considered racially impure or poor.

Even so, the lessons of that war are being forgotten as time passes, and some countries in Europe are openly xenophobic against foreigners.

As for British occupation having an impact on Indian culture, the impact you see on clothes and popular culture today is more a result of American globalism rather than British colonial influences. The governance structure is borrowed from the UK, certainly, but that is because it is easier to keep existing structures in place than to dismantle them completely and start from scratch.

You introduced an idea, particular a ""thing"" that exists, and I rejected it. I have every right to reject your idea if it has no proof, logic or credibility. I do not need to give proof your concept doesn't exist if you haven't given any proof, logic or reason that it does exist. At this point in the discussion your claim has no value.

If we were to accept every idea no matter how ridiculous, illogical or unfounded they are as credible then we would be abandoning logical thought. Your claim being unfalsifiable, meaning that it is impossible to be 100% proven false, does not mean it is a credible claim.

If you have an idea then it needs proof else it can be rejected. This stands for any idea: e.g the big bang. The big bang can be rejected if there is not proof. However there is proof and reason, such as the universe expanding or The cosmic microwave background.

fiu5jad,"Eh. My political values haven't changed from when I was a broke grad student who dropped out to start my own company and making ends meet by being a climbing guide. 

At the end of the day, I am a technocrat. I believe in solid policy and robust technology solutions, and free market capitalism enables both.

Populist policy promises a lot of things, but it can't provide a satisfactory answer for things like inheritance and property rights without - honestly - theft. You can have equality of opportunity but you cannot have equality of outcome.

People who are the top of the pyramid and can leverage scale will always be more successful. If you stopped someone like Musk and insisted that he give away all his capital, you wouldn't have everything from Tesla to SpaceX. 

The reality is that I don't trust nation states to use money efficiently or on the right things. They will pay for populist solutions whereas companies can truly invest in groundbreaking stuff. 

The two shouldn't be mutually exclusive - you cannot take capital away from companies unless you're planning to invest it equally in innovation and the future. Companies are constantly innovating - they're automating the infrastructure, digitizing, coming up with new ideas and new solutions etc. and they are scaling. If you took away that capital, can the state promise that it will dedicate the same amount to innovation vs. investing in bigger armies and more bureaucracy?

You can't - and that's basically why the Soviet Union collapsed. People were given the choice of two cars, one television, one brand of bread. Why? Because innovation and variety didn't matter. Whereas a company is incentivized to constantly keep customers happy, to optimize how it does business, and try and compete meant that it was producing new models, optimizing its manufacturing process, coming up with new designs, investing in new technologies, and offering customers options and choices.

Plus, state owned enterprises get subsidies and basically smaller enterprises knuckle down under the pressure of the state. 

But in a world where the state owned enterprise has to compete, there's never a scenario where a state owned enterprise can do so against free market competitors. Companies are constantly reimagining and innovating and disrupting the way business is done. Otherwise, you'll end up with Keltron as your TV and a choice between Fiat, Ambassador, and Maruti as your car. And why would they bother going electric or investing in auto-pilot? Why would they invest in giving you a thousand channels and OLED and bluetooth technology? No incentives.

It is easy to pick extremes from both sides, but we know at the end of the day thats not what atheism nor religion stands for.

No. Should we abolish extreme religion views though? Yes.

""I'm entitled to my opinion or I have a right to my opinion is a logical fallacy in which a person discredits any opposition by claiming that they are entitled to their opinion. The statement exemplifies a red herring or thought-terminating cliché. The logical fallacy is sometimes presented as ""Let's agree to disagree"". Whether one has a particular entitlement or right is irrelevant to whether one's assertion is true or false. Where an objection to a belief is made, the assertion of the right to an opinion side-steps the usual steps of discourse of either asserting a justification of that belief, or an argument against the validity of the objection. Such an assertion, however, can also be an assertion of one's own freedom or of a refusal to participate in the system of logic at hand.[1][2][3]""

Examples I linked above beg to differ.   


> I just wanted to clarify the reason I brought up Stalin was to show that  even when religion is completely abolished, evil things still happen.  Humans will always find another excuse to justify their heinous acts. 

Without religion, there would be fewer excuses. Religion denies reasoning or arguments. How can you argue against ""A higher power that made everything and everyone told me to do it""? The whole supernatural element denies reasoning.  


Also, religion wasn't completely abolished in USSR – Stalin later reinstated Russian Orthodox Church.  


> Scientists cannot measure and observe every single detail possible when carrying out observations or experiments. 

I don't see how that is relevant. Even then, you must prove that it can't, otherwise you're making an empty assertion. This exact statement is used by the anti-science and pro-religion crowd as well.  


> Therefore, while there is a high probability that the theory is right,  we as a society have faith that those extraneous variables do not  dismiss the theory altogether. 

No, we don't have faith. Faith is belief without evidence - something that science disallows. Science also doesn't care if a theory is dismissed - new evidence is always welcome, no matter if it is for a particular thing or against it. Science is built with a self-correcting mechanism that allows it to adapt as we gain bigger understanding of the realty. 

>  Is science more reliable than religion, definitely, but just like religion it does not 100% prove anything. 

Another statement used by the anti-science crowd. The thing is, there is no such thing as knowing 100%. There is a possibility that an experiment that usually brought the same result would bring something else. Sure, that is very unlikely to happen, but no one knows if it will never happen.  


All our knowledge is gained through observation and experimentation. Theories are built on them. If an observation is different than before, then the theory must change. Though, it is more correct to say that the theory is dismissed as it is inaccurate. If something goes against a theory, then that theory is wrong, and a new one is required.   


Religion, unlike science, doesn't prove anything at all. It makes claims as accurate as an amateur fantasy novel. Such ""knowledge"" is based on divine revelation, which, for some reason, happens only to a select few people who already believe in that religion. Science, on the other hand, is reliable as any experiment or observation can be made by anyone, even though certain things require equipment not readily available to just anyone.   


However, scientists don't like agreeing with each other. A lot of them spend plenty of their time trying to disprove what other scientists are trying to prove.

The Romanian Orthodox Church has intensified its propaganda before the referendum for redefining family in the Constitution, urging the believers to go and vote “for the marriage between a man and a woman”.
Patriarch Daniel, the head of the Romanian Orthodox Church, said on Saturday, September 29, that participating in this referendum is a “patriotic, national and profoundly democratic act” aimed at defending the marriage between a man and a woman. He criticized those who don’t support the initiative to change the Constitution and spoke about actions to “aggressively boycott and unjustly denigrate the referendum”.
Priests all over the country passed this message to their parishioners after the Sunday service. A priest in Constanta reportedly got angry as some people started to leave church as he was reading the pro-referendum message and suggested that those who don’t go to the referendum to “profess their faith are not true Christian-Orthodox believers.

fiy7osg,"I never claimed the USA was the world. I would like religious groups to be taxed their fair share. I had a wedding where we requested specifically to have no mention of God in a very religious region of the country and there was no great upheaval. I’m sorry if you have had poor experiences with religious groups in your life, and I’m sure you’re not the only one. I’m just suggesting that religions aren’t inherently evil, similar to other things that people use to control and harm others. I.e. guns, alcohol, drugs, wealth. All of these things can be used for terrible causes but can also be used for harmless things as well.

fixwh37,">invent arbitrary ""types"" of atheists that aren't actually defined. For instance, wtf is an ""emotional atheist?""

What's there to invent in that... An atheist who is an atheist because of emotions rather than logic, simple as that. 

>Atheism means they don't believe in any gods. Period. Nothing more, nothing less. 

Yes, its nothing more or nothing less if its just a belief, an emotional belief. If you want to make it logical, then you'll be judged logically. Otherwise sure you can be an atheist who feels like believing so and so and really don't care for logic, that's completely fine and dandy.",1,4,1582827844.0,,False,neutral,negative,negative,negative

That is a war of conquest. Like I said, they lost a war. Just like every other place on Earth, someone conquered the people living there before them. That isn't ""systematically eliminating"" a population.

 Unless you're arguing smallpox systematically targeted Native Americans, the population died from an uncontrollable and misunderstood plague.

Satanism is a religion. And they kill cats as part of their rituals.

China is a socialist state led by the Communist Party. DotP = Dictatorship of the Proletariat. Meaning the people, under the vanguard of the Party are in power. This is opposed to the capitalist DoC = Dictatorship of Capital. 

State ownership in a socialist system is ownership by the people.

And in all this, the state provides some socialist infrastructure, not different from the US (education, public goods, military etc).
