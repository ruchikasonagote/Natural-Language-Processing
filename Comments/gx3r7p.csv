fszl107,"Even though what we Indians experience in our country is 'colour-ism' or whatever, it's also true that Indians are incredibly racist against black people. We've seen that in so many movies and what not!

I've felt like Indians have an inherent hierarchy in their minds based on color. When I was coming to the US for my education, my mother told me what almost all mothers say, but with a twist, ""don't bring home any black guys"". I asked her if its ok if I bring home white guys, and she was like ""but why would white guys want you, you're darker than them. It's black guys who you should be worried about"".

I’m considerably fair skinned and hail from the national capital but if someone says to me north Indians are shit people I’ll agree with them, we north Indians are shit people when it comes to accepting differences. It bewilders us that two different persons can have different features and different choices.

All those people putting up stories about the US protests and elephant deaths will never look inwards at the various people from so called backward classes and Muslims who’re lynched to death everyday.

fszv6zw,"There are few things more insidious about American racism --- everything around housing, jobs, credit-worthiness, renting, etc. have lop-sided metrics that adversely affect black and latino americans. Even today there is a much higher possibility a black man will not come out of a police stop alive, than a white man. 1 of 7 black americans is likely to have spent atleast a year in jail before he turns 25. In many states, once you have been to jail, you don't get back your right to vote. In many states, you have to answer the question if you have a conviction in the past --- all of these things affect non-whites more adversely. In most cities, the police can destroy your home in the name of public safety (that they are trying to apprehend a criminal, and not be responsible for anything, see the link). States often have civil forfeiture laws where police can raid your home and take things if they things they like if they feel they have ""just cause"". All of these are means of keeping political power in a 2-party system. Civil rights became law of the land only in the late 60s in USA.

We Indians had our own thing going about caste system and untouchability.

US criticizes other countries all the time for human right violations or something of that effect, then goes and drops thousands of bombs and kills millions of civilians. They mark it as collateral damage, but when Russia fights ISIS they shout on human right violations. There's police shooting protesters across US, but they point to Hong Kong.   


And it goes vice-versa too. Russians point to US invasion of Iraq and annex Crimea, China criticizes Kashmir and has re-education camps in Xinjiang etc. etc. India does a lot of it too similarly of course.

I also felt like laughing at these people, who’re obsessed over George Floyd all of a sudden. The same people say : Oye Bihari!, North East Chink, Nepali, Pandi, Mallu, Madrasi, Gora (for North Indians).....

I’m from MH and in my society , the term Bihari itself is a joke. No matter what the situation is, majority of us love to bash them. Including me back then! When i was young i used to think that it was some word like idiot, stupid or something. But later i realized what i was just saying and just stopped it forever.

Similarly i once had to go to Kerala for 4 months as a part of a project. After a while i came to know that , the term ‘Bengali’ is a Running Gag in there.  
Primarily due to the overwhelming presence of migrant workers, you can find them everywhere , anytime. Along with that they speak with a different malayalam accent when they learn it, which is obvious as they aren’t natives. 

Due to all of this , migrant workers are colloquially called as Bengalis, but they maybe from anywhere!
Even their accent is used to mock others, similar to how broken english is used in trolls. 
In the same fashion, i came across the word Pandi , addressing Tamilians. 
The same way i had seen Kannadigas and Tamilians address keralites as Mallus, which i think is a bit offensive when a Non-Keralite uses it. 
Another thing which shocked me was that in TN, there is a strong hatred against Hindi. I also was discriminated in some places for not knowing Tamil.
In Karnataka , there was a racist incident against Students from North East. On the other hand i’ve seen racist comments by NE people against Keralites for some reason. 
In North India as you said , the hatred against South is also pretty strong in some places. 
So this is all balanced. We all are a bunch of racist savages, who would love to hate each other but get offended to the core when a foreigner does it. 

But technically, yes. In the eyes of the average white bigot, Indians also count as Black. So we’re in the same boat as them.",2,0,1591407068.0,,False,negative,negative,positive,negative

ft1jdjq,"While I get that there might be some hypocrisy in this context, but I believe that this movement is about black americans being treated differently by the system and not simply for ""making their fun"" or ""calling them names"". Racism is differentiating or discriminating in effect, and not calling out a race. People are called blacks browns and whites because that's an easy way to identify them. Which is alright and I don't see anything wrong with it. There is noninsukt attached to the word ""black"" or ""kaala"" that I can notice. It is only how you're taking it. It's just naming the color of their skin. Objective. However..

There is absolutely no harm in calling a black person black. They call them that themselves and it is anything but unreasonable. But what is wrong is pulling them over and randomly investigate about drugs, for example. Besting them without charges. Not letting them inside a public place. In India, we call people kaala and gora all the time, but we sure don't suppress them. Because there is no subject matter there.

I've been calling it out amongst my predominantly light skinned South Indian family for a while now. Chiding uncle's, aunts, grandparents, etc for comments about skin tone. Lashing out at commercials for fair and lovely and the celebrities who stupidly endorse it.
But of late, I do it less as I can no longer ignore the fact that it is rooted in me as well. I too have the implicit biases against darker skinned folk in India - that they may belong to a lower economic class, especially if they speak certain dialects.
Having lived in the former ""white utopia"" of Oregon for the last 12 years, I see it too in my comfort level (or lack thereof) around black people in America, as opposed to white people. Especially since I moved recently to TX where the black community is much larger. I wouldn't go as far as to call it racism - but more a lack of exposure. I'm almost a bit more careful around them, not to say or do anything offensive, try to be cool and hip. I think I was like that around white people when I first immigrated to the US, but having had many dear white friends since, have gotten over it. And in time, this initial awkward phase too I shall grow out of. I certainly hope so.
""Liberal snowflake"" that I am, I certainly support the BLM movement, but in the Indian way, which is ideologically, not practically. I need to put my money where my mouth is and go mingle, make friends and get to know my fellow dark skinned humans, both in America and in my own homeland.

I would say racism is worse than colourism. And casteism is the main problem in India. 


Now going back to colour and race. There is no exact definition of race when it comes to racists. All they care about is if the person looks different from them. In the past white race was only Americans and people from England, France, Germany, etc. The Italians and Irish weren't considered as white. People of African origin with dark skin are considered as black. And even if one parent is white and other is black then the child is considered black. That's how racism is for racists. All they care is if people look different. 


Here in India the darker skinned people are not seen as others but are seen as inferior and unlikable. That's a lesser form of racism. India does have its own racism against North East people and Southern people because we look more different to the majority.

In this regard, Casteism is a more apt face of racism in India. Inter-caste marriages are still a taboo. Dalits are still treated as untouchables despite laws ""forbidding"" such discrimination. They are humiliated, mutilated and tortured, even in established institutions with zero repercussions. This kind of activities are much rampant in rural, sub-urban and even urban areas but probably less in metropolitan cities.

ft03qf8,"Actually it's a universal human thing, going back millennia. For the longest time, having dark skin meant that you spent most of your time outside, presumably working with your hands for your living. Being fair-skinned meant that you were wealthy enough to hang around indoors all day, out of the sun.

In India, there's probably a double effect going on, in that there's residual ethnocentrism still hanging on from back when Indo-Aryan people invaded the subcontinent, between three and four thousand years ago. At the time, it's likely that the majority of the people living there were fairly dark-skinned Dravidians, and the lighter-skinned Indo-Aryans probably had a considerable bias against them as conquered people, some of which no doubt survives to this day.

A common parallel has involved fingernails. In several cultures, notably Qing-dynasty China, long fingernails carried the same connotation as fair skin, because they very obviously indicated that you didn't need to use your hands for anything important.

It's only in the past 150 years or so in European cultures (which, for the purposes of this issue includes the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and to a limited extent, Latin America) that having a bronze tan has been seen as desirable, because with the switchover of economies in those countries to industry instead of agriculture, being pale meant that you had to stay inside a factory or office all day in order to make your living, whereas being tanned means that you have the means to sit around all day wearing very little and doing even less in places that have weather that's nice enough for that kind of itinerary to be feasible.

I am not dark. In fact, as a fairer south Indian, I have enjoyed privileges that a regular dark southie wouldn't. People automatically assume I'm educated and wealthy. If someone in public got pickpocketed or something, I would be the last person to be suspected, because come on.

Of course, it's not just 'fair skin'. It's also my upper caste, relatively wealthier background, ability to speak English at play here. I am privileged at each of this. But I am sure if I had all of these privileges  but was darker, I would have faced suspicion and bluntness far more than I have faced otherwise.

Edit: I must mention that the experiences I write here are from a south Indian perspective. I didn't enjoy these privileges up north because people there are generally fairer.",46,1,1591367780.0,Froogler,1591367993.0,negative,neutral,neutral,neutral

missing the point of OP's post, namely, using other people's struggles as a distraction to avoid looking within. Basically whataboutism.

Also. Colorism IS racism. 

**Racism** *noun*

*prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race ^(or other attribute) based on the belief that one's own race ^(or other attribute) is superior.*

Replace ""race"" with ""caste"". Or ""gender"". Or ""color"". Or ""tribe"", or ""accent"", or ""job"", or *any fucking word you like.* That attribute becomes your race.

It's *the same* in every case - maybe a few different bells and whistles, but it's all based on the same core. The core system of ""this is a quality that hurts no one, but we have decided is less desirable and we will make it your problem"". It's _all_ some form of racism.

ft0dvsn,">Actually it's a universal human thing, going back millennia.

No, it isn't. I keep seeing this assertion and it's not wholly accurate. It depends heavily upon which part of the world you're talking about, and it doesn't extrapolate to South Asia at all, because our history and beauty ideals are completely different even going back to ancient times. In comparison, the preference for paler skin is something that is outright written down and quoted as an idea in ancient and historical texts from countries like China, Japan and Korea, and its lines are cited and passed down through generations.

And even here, there are crucial differences. In East Asia, pale skin is something that is directly considered as related to one's own moral character, such that heroes in Asian mythology are *explicitly* depicted as fair, because fairness = goodness, virtue, purity, etc. It's only in South East Asia (countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, etc) where pale skin is linked to one's wealth and income.

In comparison, no such link between the colour of one's skin and the extent of one's moral character was ever made in Hindu mythology. The Rig Veda has multiple descriptions of gods who are dark skinned, and it's asserted that the author of the Rig Veda himself was dark skinned. There are actually multiple descriptions in various texts that describe beautiful or handsome people as having dark skin. Paleness was never an indicator of one's goodness and virtue in ancient Indian society, nor was it an indicator of one's status, either income or otherwise. Amar Chitra Katha and other depictions really fucked with this perception for our generation, if you ask me.

Even the whole Aryan-Dravidian clash that's been narrativized to include some prejudice based on colour was false--people are applying a modern mindset to a time when that sort of attitude simply didn't exist. The Aryans had conflict with the Dravidians because they wanted to take over the territory, and the locals didn't want to let them. The ""darkness"" of their skin was a descriptor, not a means of discrimination.

The history of the preference for pale skin and its development over time + the associated prejudice that goes with it was something that was directly influenced by the Mughals and mostly by the British. The Mughals, while they might have said that pale skin is an ideal of beauty, did not discriminate against darker skinned people when it came to jobs and status. The British were the ones who reified that attitude in large part because they had an open preference for choosing light skinned Indians for positions in the colonial administration. They're the ones who stated that their superiority was on the basis of their fair skin, and that the darker one's skin, the more inferior they were, and that's the holdover people are still struggling with today.",3,2,1591389044.0,MissionStatistician,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

Modern racism is a distinct and historically-specific form of discrimination, that European colonization spread to every part of the world. There is no such thing as the ""white"" race for most of human history, and most Europeans understood themselves as part of their local community or religion, not as part of a race. That changes once there's more contact with people with darker skin tones.

>The period of the Renaissance and Reformation was also the time when Europeans were coming into increasing contact with people of darker pigmentation in Africa, Asia, and the Americas and were making judgments about them. The official rationale for enslaving Africans was that they were heathens, but slave traders and slave owners sometimes interpreted a passage in the book of Genesis as their justification. Ham, they maintained, committed a sin against his father Noah that condemned his supposedly black descendants to be ""servants unto servants."" When Virginia decreed in 1667 that converted slaves could be kept in bondage, not because they were actual heathens but because they had heathen ancestry, the justification for black servitude was thus changed from religious status to something approaching race. Beginning in the late seventeenth century laws were also passed in English North America forbidding marriage between whites and blacks and discriminating against the mixed offspring of informal liaisons.

ft1vv0l,">The notion that just because you have suffered you will empathise is wrong.

That's not quite it. It's not the suffering that makes a person empathetic, it's whether or not they can relate to systems of inequality around the world and the experiences of people who live and bear the fallout from those systems.

Yes, poor people have prejudices and are discriminatory and small minded. But they also know first hand that the world is weighted against the poor, that they don't have a voice because they don't have the money or the clout and connections that go with it. They know if the police killed them tomorrow for absolutely no reason, there would be no justice, and they'd likely be blamed for their own death by people who have no clue what it's like to be poor and powerless like that. It's a question of understanding and figuring out the realities of the world as they live in and interact with it. 

So while they might very well be racist on the surface when interacting with a black person, they are simultaneously more likely to relate and empathize when you explain the structural inequality black people suffer from, because they share those experiences in their own life. If you sat them down and told them about how police killings are rampant and there's no justice or accountability, they would be able to relate it to their own experiences. It doesn't mean you don't have blind spots in your own treatment of others, especially if you're more privileged than another person when it comes to questions of caste, gender and religion. But your understanding is shaped by the life you've lived.

Whereas your NRI uncle who has never experienced such a life is not only less likely to be aware of how it affects people, but is also less likely to care, let alone make an effort to understand what is going on. He's more likely to blame victims for their own victimization rather than understand how things like poverty and race make a person a target for such discrimination, or even accept that these types of inequalities exist and have a negative affect on people, because he's never had that experience himself. Wealth is a powerful insulator. Look at the way people talked about the migrant worker deaths for example. ""It's their own fault for trying to walk home, they should know to stay put.""

Colourism in Japan is something that has been a fixture in their society from at least the 8th century, if not earlier. This has been attested in their literature from that period of time until today. Paleness of skin as an ideal, as an indication of one's moral goodness was a prevalent notion in their literature, and women in Japan were whitening their skin as a moral imperative from as far back as the 8th century. 

No equivalent notion existed in Indian society and Indian literature. Indian mythology is littered with protagonists that are dark skinned but are still heroic. Even those described as beautiful are described as having dark skin as a feature of their beauty. Paleness is not attributed to one's goodness or heroism. Even the connections between pale skin and caste or the Aryan-Dravidian divide are murky and the relationship between the two is not a hard and fast rule, for the simple reason that dark skinned people of higher castes existed and dark skinned Aryans also existed, and neither group was demonized specifically because of their dark skin. One's beauty was not specifically linked to the colour of one's skin for much of Indian history, more emphasis was placed on things like physical figure, the shape of a person's eyes, etc.

The idea that it's a ""residual ethnocentricism"" is also debatable and the notion has been challenged because there's very little evidence, either textual or otherwise, to support it. The conflict between the Aryans and the Dravidians was not justified on the basis of skin colour, because such justifications didn't exist at the time.

And you're right. I did forget to address a few things. The desire for bronzed and tan skin most definitely isn't linked to the growth of factory and ""inside"" labour vs having the money/wealth to go on endless vacations to sunny parts of the world either. The desire for a tan has far more to do with the fact that, for white people in particular, paleness became a symbol of ill health and malnourishment. Vitamin D deficiency was discovered to be a cause of rickets, and tanning/sun exposure was prescribed as a remedy.

ft2ykbe,"First paragraph, I missed it. Thanks to pointing that out. 

I believe all cultures that interacted with Europeans developed a single word to clearly identify them as a single group regardless of their religion or local community. For example, in Japan, Nanban Jin (Southern Barbarian) came to describe all Europeans not just the Dutch or just the Portuguese exclusively. I don’t think “modern racism” is a distinct as you might think. Look into East Asian history. 

Also, I think you might be confusing something that has existed for a very long time and became a useful category at some recent point in history for something that only came into existence during European colonialism. I understand many Europeans in the past would identify themselves as distinct with their local community rather than the broader European race but that’s partially because most of them likely never interacted non-European people so that distinction wasn’t very useful. 


Right now, we’d probably all refer to ourselves as human. This makes some sense because we’re the only human species around. But this isn’t a biological certainty. Let’s say, through some advancement in biotech, 50 years from now, we resurrect Homo neanderthalensis. Perhaps, through advancements in infotech and biotech, some of us change so much that this new and advanced group is distinct and easily identifiable- let’s call them Homo Deus. Suddenly  there are three species from the genus homo living and interacting with each other. The term human doesn’t really make sense so the terms Sapiens, Neanderthal, and Deus could popularly be employed to clearly distinguish. It’s not that Sapiens didn’t exist before neanderthals were resurrected and Deus was born but the term wasn’t as useful. The way people “understood themselves” in the past doesn’t undermine the underlying biological reality that Europeans, as a distinct and easily distinguished people, have existed for a very long time. 

I get your point that the way racism is enacted has changed in the last few centuries. Europeans have played a big part in how much the world has rapidly changed since the 1400s. The European colonialist variety of racism may have altered the culture of global racism just as much as it altered the global culture in general. But I think racism has always existed because there seems to be a kind of preference or bias for one’s own race built into our biology. Even babies less than a year old have bias for their own race. 

I’ve seen this subjective view about race and other things  more frequently lately. I think it’s coming from the humanities department in universities over the last 70-80 years when they began to decide objective truth doesn’t exist or doesn’t matter.

ft8oot0,"You and I have a very different understanding of that line from Parasite. The way I understood it was not that wealth protects you from the hardships of life and stops you from being ruthless. My understanding is that their wealth is a direct factor in making it easier for them to give the appearance of being generous without actually having to be generous, because all it takes to give that impression is a minuscule fraction of their wealth. It's much easier to give off the impression that you're a nice, generous person when you have so much money that you can spend it without having to be a nice, generous human being. That's the privilege that money allows you. It helps hide the fact that you lack empathy or compassion under the facade of materialism.

I don't know why you're still stuck on emotions and whether people can be ""good or bad"" regardless of social strata when that's not my point at all. My point is this: poor people have far greater lived experience dealing with unequal treatment from systems and institutions of power, because they have actually lived with that reality their whole life. They have experienced it first hand, and this includes all the assholes you're talking about. This makes them acutely aware of the systematic inequality they face in society in a way that a wealthy, privileged person would not, because they lack that lived experience. People are experts on their own lives first and foremost. And having knowledge about the inequality you experience in your day to day life is not contingent on how nice or kind or good you are as a human being. None of that is a factor in having the basic understanding of just how much you lack in the world in terms of power and control over your circumstances.

When you treat the poor like they're dunces who don't know anything about the inequality that they constantly live with, you're perpetuating that same system that victimizes them. Poor people are capable of making astute and shrewd observations regarding the power dynamics in this world in a way that a person who is not a victim of those dynamics often can't. You don't need a college education to be able to take stock of your own life and go, ""That's fucked up, and here's what I would want improved."" You don't need a college education to know what it's like to lack the money and the clout necessary to get justice for someone who's unlawfully murdered by the police. You don't need a degree to understand that the police target specifically the people who lack the resources to fight back because that helps them escape accountability. You don't need a masters in sociology to see that society overwhelmingly favours the wealthy at the expense of the poor, that people with wealth leverage their wealth and status against the poor, that the poor are exploited at the hands of the wealthy.

This is why making blanket statements like, ""The country is full of poor, uneducated people who are too stupid to not know how to treat people equally in accordance with liberal values, which is why we're still a backwards, unwashed society,"" is a stupid ass statement to make. It's stupid for a bunch of different reasons, not least of which being the fact that lacking education or wealth doesn't mean you lack a brain. It's also a good way to let the actual people who prevent the poor from moving up in society and getting an education off the hook. Industrialists and billionaires profit greatly from keeping their labour force uneducated and illiterate, from holding this country back, and then blame the poor for preventing the country from progressing toward some fantasy liberal panacea due to their lack of education in the same breath. I object to this bullshit purely because it punts the blame from the people upon whom it should rest. It's not the poor who are holding the country back, it's the people who have a vested interest in making sure those people stay poor and powerless who are responsible for that. And those below or at the poverty line know this, even though a lot of ""educated liberals"" don't.

Your statement that, ""Well poor people can be bad too, they can also perpetuate inequality and not have the capacity to empathize!!"" is like okay, and? What of it? How does that change any of what I said? My point has nothing to do with that. You can be aware of your own lived experiences as far as inequality is concerned and have your own blind spots regarding the way you yourself oppress and leverage your privilege against others who are less powerful than you. Those two things can, and do, co-exist. But let's stop treating the poor like they're too stupid to know anything about inequality, period, just because they haven't read Voltaire or whoever. They know more than people are willing to give them credit for, and they damn sure know more about their own life than either you, or me, or anyone who hasn't lived the same life they have lived would know.

ft5n7xl,"I've enjoyed studying the humanities and I think I've got a pretty good grasp. But I fear postmodernism has infected that area of study and conflicts sharply with enlightenment values like reasoning, objective reality and the pursuit of truth. Instead it pushes ideology and tries to shut down open discourse. Taken to its logical conclusion, I think this will lead to tremendous violence. 

Race is definitely biological. Stating that it is simply a cultural definition is objectively false. Consider this -

Idi Amin, Nelson Mandela, Marcus Aurelius, Adolf Hitler, and Cryus the Great were all sapiens and could theoretically produce fertile offspring with Harriet Tubman, Debra Brown, Mother Teresa, or Joan of Ark, not to mention female neanderthals.
We know that environment plays a part in determining the characteristics of sapiens but seemingly small differences in DNA do also. You could subjectively say that there is no “great” biological difference between Marcus Aurelius and the Neanderthal version of Debra Brown on death row because they’re able to reproduce and simply conclude that this amount DNA difference is irrelevant. You could also say that DNA varies more within racial groups than between them so race doesn’t exist. That, a slightly better argument, is the current position of many scientists who have submitted to the danger of political incorrectness.
Should we conclude that race is a inter-subjective social construct and if we subjectively feel that it doesn’t matter it will be of no importance? We could, but that ignores the objective differences and leaves us just as ignorant and helpless as we are today.

We know that DNA differences between races results in significant average differences in the risk of specific diseases, sprinting speed, coping with high altitudes and IQ. It is not known what other important differences are caused by these seemingly small genetic variations. The productive way forward is to have the humility to admit our ignorance and seek the objective scientific truth not to assume it doesn’t exist or doesn’t matter. Once we understand, hopefully, we will have the power to ease society’s racial suffering if we choose to.

The human genome has been sequenced and we can easily differentiate between “whites” and non-whites. Not only that but we can identify who is an Ashkenazi Jew, Sicilian, or Northern European without ever having met them socially.
Objective realities exist and affect us regardless if we believe in them or not. Gravity and DNA are objective realities. Subjective realities are feelings like experiencing flowers being beautiful, a passionate feeling that people shouldn’t be racially biased or wholeheartedly feeling gravity doesn’t exist and isn’t based on facts. Inter-subjective realities (like social constructs) are very important too. But I think you’re confusing something that is objective, based on facts, for something inter-subjective.

Distinguishing between types of realities and appreciating each is important. A man who feels gravity isn’t based on facts could feel comfortable jumping off the roof of a skyscraper. Regardless of how this person feels, gravity exists so he will fall toward the ground and die upon impact. We could collectively decide that race doesn’t exist or the entire sapiens population could even magically get amnesia erasing our memory of race or simultaneously develop a neurological condition that prevents us from distinguishing between races. Each and every person would now forget race exists or feel it doesn’t exist. Race would cease to be a inter-subjective reality but the objective reality of DNA differences and the important average differences in characteristics affecting society across races like IQ, and specific disease risk would still affect us.

You just heaped a bunch of statements on me which I neither made nor implied. I don't know how you landed on the assumption that I said that poor people are stupid. They are not.

That's a strawman, and you are not describing postmodernism but bog standard modernist anthropology and sociology. A ~~postmodernist~~post-structuralist would claim there are no individuals or structures that can be reliably identified and form the basis of knowledge.

Saying something is a social construct does not mean it is something we can ""get over"" or cure easily, but it has to be done. Social constructs, like money and nations, have enormous significance to the world but should we disregard them because they are social constructs?

Again, strawman of the scientific evidence.

>In fact any two unrelated human beings on the planet are 99.9% identical in their DNA sequence. Only 0.1% varies, and here’s the most important takeaway message from all this. It also happens to be the most replicated finding in the scientific literature on human variation.

> 
> And since skull sizes are being discussed again in certain corners of the Internet, 90% of the variability in their volume also occurs within (and not between) human groups.
> 
> This is a big snag in the argument that race is a biological reality. This finding—that there’s more diversity within than between groups—is true for most physical traits, with one prominent exception: skin colour. Why? Because skin colour is under tremendous selective pressure. It varies depending on how far from the equator we are, because a darker skin offers better protection against sunburn, skin cancer and related damages. People with naturally darker skin were better adapted to their environment and were more likely to reproduce. The fact that a Maasai and an Aboriginal Australian both have very dark skin is not because they are part of the same biological race, but rather because both have lived under a very harsh sun for generations. So skin colour is not evidence of race being a biological reality.

> The truth about sickle cell anemia is more complicated than that. The sickle cell trait is a variant in our DNA that offers protection against malaria. Over many generations, people who were exposed to malaria were more likely to reproduce if they had this trait, so this trait was selected for. When you have two copies of it, however, you can develop sickle cell anemia. So do only Black people carry the trait? No. While it is commonly seen in people of sub-Saharan African ancestry, it can also be found in Mediterraneans, Middle Easterners, and Indians. It is not restricted to one race but rather to many populations that were all exposed to malaria.
> 
> But there is another example where race seems to play a role in medicine: the drug BiDil, the first race-based prescription drug in the US which aims to treat heart failure. It was said to be a breakthrough for African Americans, but here’s the twist: the clinical trial that led to its approval only tested African Americans. How can you pretend your drug can only treat one race when you haven’t tested it in another?
> 
> One final argument for the existence of biological races is that African Americans have more health problems than White Americans: more likely to have high blood pressure, disproportionately affected by obesity, and at an increased risk for diabetes. But given that there is much more genetic diversity within African Americans than between them and White Americans, it’s unlikely that the answer simply lies in their DNA. As a parallel, single men are more likely to die of heart disease than their married counterparts, but genes don’t make us married or single. If Black was a biological race and if hypertension was only genetic, we would expect Black people all over the world to have the same risk for it, but they don’t. While hypertension is more prevalent among African Americans than in White Americans, the rate in sub-Saharan Africans is lower than either!
> 
> Racial health disparities within countries are often due to the physical tax of discrimination, poverty, an increased risk of living near hazardous waste facilities, lack of access to healthcare, and differences in behaviour. And this is important: race is not imaginary simply because it’s not biological. Our perception of it has real consequences on the health of others because of how differently we treat them. As a study from the early 1990s demonstrates, infant mortality is twice as high in African Americans than in their white counterparts… unless you look at members of these groups who are enrolled in the military and receive care at the same army medical centre. For them, infant mortality rates are more or less the same.
> 
> Some doctors still use race as a useful proxy, but this assumption carries with it the risk of withholding effective treatment for some and of using ineffective treatment in others. Socioeconomic factors, culture, behaviour, and where a patient’s ancestors came from are more informative.

It happens that we have different ideas about the conclusions or worldview we think are important to effectively increase well-being. Would you say that's fair?

I'm tempted to feel that way now but I think it's better to have the humility to consider the fact that I could be wrong and really consider the ideas you're presenting. 

I read your comments and the large quote from the article you pasted as well as the article itself. I honestly don't think any of it negates my point. Race is an objective biological reality. 

The first comment you described as a strawman was not a presentation of the weakest form of your argument so I could easily knock it down. It was a question asked to aid in the categorization of race into the correct type of reality. Also, I'm not saying inter-subjective realities (social constructs) are east to ""get over"" and I'm certainly not saying we should disregard them. Creating and using inter-subjective entities could be viewed as the primary property of sapiens that sets us apart from other animals.

The second of my points you claim is a strawman of scientific evidence is not. At the end of the article, in a area you didn’t include in the quote, the author basically re-labels race as 'biological ancestry"" and states it is real. He writes, ""Where our forebears came from can be seen in our DNA..."" He vaguely and hurriedly states that race and ""biological ancestry"" are distinct. This kind of argument seems like a blatantly desperate attempt by the author to deny what's obvious. Both visually and by examining DNA, races are objective and distinguishable. DNA is clearly part of biology. DNA determines what sapiens body's look like and we can see bodies. We can easily visually identify race. If all of a person's recent forebears are European and I meet this person in London, a city of great racial diversity, I will never mistakenly wonder if all of this person's forebears are from West Africa. This result would be completely consistent across a population because a portion of each European's DNA is consistently distinct enough within all Europeans to result in accurate categorization by sight alone. Almost all of the time, it doesn't even require an advanced look into this person's DNA. Visual differences are not limited to skin color and are driven by biology.

I understand the fact that all sapiens' DNA sequence is 99.9% identical. However, Neanderthals and sapiens DNA is 99.7% the same. Obviously, a small amount to DNA variation can result in very important differences. I also understand that for the 0.1% that varies there is more variation within racial groups than there is between races. But does that mean races aren't different enough to be a biological reality? That seems silly to me. 

The seemingly small DNA variation size doesn't matter as much as the fact that the small difference consistently results in average differences in functional characteristics important to society. The key is in averages. As I wrote before, we know that DNA differences between races results in significant average differences in the risk of specific diseases, sprinting speed, coping with high altitudes and IQ. It is not known what other important differences are caused by these seemingly small genetic variations.

Let’s say there is a term that categorizes things distinctly from one another. The test to tell if it exists objectively is to look at variation patterns between the things being compared. If there is more variation within groups than between them, the term isn’t useful and exists only as a social construct. Let’s apply this to height. For argument’s sake let’s say the tallest adult human in both Sweden and an area of central Africa is 7 feet. The shortest adult in both areas stands at 2 feet. That’s a 5-foot variation. Let’s make the comparison between countries. The average height in this central African area where pygmies happen to live with a hand full of Bantu (one being an amazing 7 feet tall) is 4 feet 1 inch. Up in Sweden, the average height is 5 feet 11 inches. The Variation between countries is only about 2 feet. This is far less than variation within areas (5 feet) so height must not be based in biology. Height only exists as social construct and isn’t based in the underlying objective biological reality that affects the pygmy’s ability to reach high things whether he believes in height or not.  This seems silly. Height affects us weather we feel it’s real or not. That’s why it’s actually an objective biological reality whether we feel it is or not.

I will not be commenting any more because it will just be more flamatory as our ideas are not the same. Peace fellas.,-1,9,1591383190.0,ankitk2909,False,neutral,neutral,positive,neutral

ft8ayup,"Taking bribes is not remotely the same as supporting murders.  One is a corruption mindset, while other is a brutality and us vs them mindset. Police Corruption can be caused by many things like low pay, wider acceptance of corruption in the culture etc. Police brutality is different.  US police don't take bribes, but that doesn't mean they are not murdering people.",0,1,1591497174.0,cherryreddit,False,negative,negative,negative,negative
ft8cd9p,"Is having protests is a sign of lack of problem? That's a stupid conclusion. Having protests means there is a problem .
If there was no racism and brutality there wouldn't be any protests. And yes , it is very rotten. 

I have seen many of instances of police lathi charging people. I have been in a protest crowd which was lathi charged myself. And I also know that in these cases they were following orders, whether they come directly from their higher ups or some politician does it through their higher ups. 

 However I am yet to see a Indian police publicly killing a unarmed and unresisting person on his own motivation.  The police in India would rather sit with you for chai after you are lathi charged and send you home if possible than try to kill you . 
If i am blind to could you show me an instance of Indian police executing an unarmed civilian in broad daylight, especially which was not punished in court?


And please stop trying to pin the sins of our political class on the police. The common people are the ones who elected these rowdy sheeters and feudal leaders to power and then expect a ill funded police department to protect them from their sins.",1,1,1591498045.0,cherryreddit,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

fweyiy0,"With recent news being in popular media - Jayaraj and Fenix case, do you still feel the same way? Do you still think police in India are harmless and never take power in their hand? These kind of cases happen often but they never get traction in news because victims are from lower middle class or poor people. With BLM, i'm happy these news are becoming mainstream.",1,2,1593469688.0,dhmy4089,1593470127.0,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
ft8eho2,"I'm not saying they dont have problem. They obviously do. Their coverage and protests makes you feel their situation is worse than India. But the truth is coverage is non-existant in India. Indian police don't use weapons unless dealing with gang fights or encounters (some are questionable). It doesn't mean their lathi charges are acceptable which causes grave injury to people. There are so many people with means who calls police for their own purpose, with money, police take power in their hands and harm victims. There is a reason that there is so much fear for being arrested and spending night in police station. So many of them have false FIR and  some none and never gets in front of judge.",0,2,1591499397.0,dhmy4089,False,negative,negative,negative,negative
