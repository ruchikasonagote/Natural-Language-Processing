Howl with me today. Howl so that they remember who we are.

Howl loud enough so that we remember who we are.

Howl in the name of our independence for which thousands of people sacrificed their lives but we tend to forget that to maintain that state of independence we need to keep fighting for it.

But having said that, no matter which field you choose to pursue, you will be an asset to this country.

For the rest of us, please remember that the fight is not over. As long as WhiteHatJr exists, all of us who has been a part of this fight needs to do what it takes at their level to protect innocent parents from falling victim to these scamster companies including Byju. Never underestimate the power of an determined mind against all odds of corporate money power. Whenever we come across any advertisement or posts promoting WhiteHatJr, we need to step up and contribute a little time to comment their why parents should not pay money to these croocks. The company is now rapidly spreading to USA. And millions of innocent parents are just waiting to be scammed. Same here in India, as long as this company has money power they will continue their agenda. Pradeep has shown us the path, we all need to walk on that path.

White hat Jr- WHJ started their business by selling courses for children teaching Coding. In actuality they were just ripping off code.com platform to the point after sign up and payment with WHJ the children were made to sign up to code.org , plus they were teaching drag and drop as coding.

 POONIA a normie IT employee tried to expose this and was being banned on all the platform he was trying to tell the truth about this company, from Twitter to LinkedIn. Then when he made a post on Reddit it blew up with multiple awards and more people seeing it. WHJ the  filed a **20cr defamation case** on Poonia, he posted on reddit and that post also blew up and was visible to alot. Everyone from r/india supported him. Poonia decided to fight the defamation case, WHJ hired the ex Attourny General of India to represent WHJ. Poonia and his Lawyer ran laps around these WHJ Lawers and made them sweat, the last few hearings WHJ tried to keep postponing the case and running away from the leagle fight, after Poonias awesome lawyer gave WHJ a good thrashing in defamation law. She is an awesome lawyer.  Poonia has balls of steel and it goes to show everyon can grow thos balls, we just need to stand up and fight. 

There are alot of other things that happened like poonia showing chat logs from WHJ CEO telling his Reputation management team to force takedown of social media post. And some directly targeting Poonia, and also confessing on chat that they will make fictious courses to sell to gullible parents.
