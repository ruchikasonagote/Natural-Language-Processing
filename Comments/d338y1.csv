ezyt8f6,"Reminds me of one of the Nawabs of erstwhile Awadh (Oudh), Shuja-ud-Daulah. He was a very benevolent and religiously tolerant ruler. So much so that once the Hindu festival Holi and the Islamic mourning day of Muharram fell on the same day. Being a devout Muslim himself, he couldn't see any reason why Hindus shouldn't celebrate Holi amidst the Muharram processions. So he asked Muharram processions to be taken out the next day so that his Hindu subjects could celebrate Holi. That used to be the religious harmony and tolerance back in those days.",62,0,1568274231.0,arthurfleck_23,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

ezyffdj,"salafists hate muharram procession. some of my salafi friends keep preaching about how it is haram. the change i have observed in them  past few years is alarming, sometimes make me think they hate other muslims the most.

you can thank the saudi funded preachers for the change in my town. new mosques were built everywhere and the preachers are all salafis., you cannot compete with money.at the time of muharram procession you can clearly see the divide created by the saudi ideology in the indian muslim community

The community welfare aspects of Islam was replaced with strict adherence to rituals in the period right after the demise of the fourth Caliph, when the monarchs took over rule. This was done so that they could create a population that wouldn't question the legitimacy of their rule.

So for almost all of it's history, Muslims have not learned how to deal with political nuances, as preached by Islam. This is what leads to religious leaders being able to manipulate Muslims into being constantly angry and find the harsh (easy and non-intellectual) solution.

So the part that says 'respect the non-believers religion and worship' is easily replaced with 'find every opportunity to vocally (and sometimes abusively) remind them that they are wrong'.

Muslims are Muslims own worst enemies.

What the Wahhabists are doing now is cementing their political control over the rest of the Muslim world.

But don't for a minute think they are doing it alone. It is with the complete support of countries like the US and Israel.

This political reality is important to understand if you want to know why the Muslims who are striving for reform are invisible. Because it is bad for politics to let them be heard.

Naqvi said that most of the elite Muslims in India have historically been the ones with foreign lineage, like he himself came from some place on the borders of Iran and Afghanistan. Also Iran being closest to India meant that the Shia in India were basically all foreign while the 80% Sunni had a vast majority of indigenous converts. Hence a Shia was likelier to be upper caste/class than a Sunni. 

So he said that the outcome of this was that shias in India were to other Muslims what the brahmins or rajputs were to Hindus. So there was a difference in culture and shias were closer to Hindus also so they had a very syncretic culture but now the wahabbi money meant that most of the upcoming Muslims were Sunni (formerly) lower and middle class people who never had that culture of syncretism. The wahabbi influence is also making out any form of syncretism to be ""innovation"" and thereby forbidden, so all the syncretic activities like going to Sufi dargahs are now forbidden to wahabbis or salafis.

His main point was about RSS communalism of course but he did highlight the problems that the famous syncretism of Indian elite culture was built largely on Shia traditions and that the new democratic India will have problems when the more puritanical version of wahabbis will lead to even Muslims rejecting syncretism (even means besides the intolerant Hindus who talk about not going to Sufi shrines and hate Urdu in Bollywood).",2,3,1568276192.0,SandomRtranger1,False,neutral,neutral,positive,neutral

ezzph6p,"Secularism is supposed to have 3 aspects:

1. Right to an individual to freely worship the religion of his choice. 

2. Universal citizenship ie for the State the religious affiliation should have no bearing on your rights, your duties or the laws you follow. 

3. Complete separation of the State from religion. 


India follows some garbled religious neutrality model. What this means is that the State will be allowed to violate any of the above 3 principles as long as it is seen to be ""neutral"" while doing it. 

India violates 2 when it forces monogamy on Hindus or Sikhs but not for Muslims. A Secular State can't have different set of laws for different citizens or it is no longer a secular state. A universal civil code not biased towards any religion is the primary requirement to be secular. 

India also violates 3 with impunity. The SC arrogates to itself the right to define essential practices of a religion and then reserves the right to unilaterally alter any non essential practice for any reason it sees fit. Where a US Supreme Court will outlaw some practice (let's say hypothetically some Christian practice) then it will so it because it violates some US law or maybe their Bill of rights. The Indian supreme court will first read the Bible, then call up the Vatican church for clarifications and then declare that in the ""true Christian faith"" this practice is not present therefore India is reforming Christianity and removing this evil practice by making it illegal. 

You see the difference right, the secular state makes and enforces laws without worrying about what the true religion was and what the evil perversions that have to be corrected are. The Indian state has to pussyfoot around interpreting the holy book and telling what is the correct way to practice religion.

f00a8u7,"That's a metaphor dude. So there's Brahmacharya and there's different versions of it. The one Sabrimala's deity follows is that he's a brahmachari who has gone away to the forest as he doesn't want to be tempted by women. This is the Orthodox Hindu interpretation of it as brahmacharis were the ones going away to the mountains or forests to avoid temptation. 

Gandhi was a brahmachari too and in around 1940 he got the idea of testing his faith and he started sleeping naked with young women in his entourage including his niece who was some 16 odd years old. He didn't do anything sexual apparently, his experiment was basically to see if he got aroused and also to see whether the women got aroused. This isn't WhatsApp history. Everyone knew this at that time. Patel and Nehru wrote agonized letters to Gandhi to give up his experiments. It was no secret. 

So my metaphor built on the observation that Indian secularism is basically flirting with all religions instead of being separate from religion entirely. So the Indian model was that of Gandhi which can work ethically (strict neutrality in its interactions with religions) only if the guy practicing it is a Mahatma. If the guy practising it isn't Gandhi then you get an Asaram Bapu who abuses secularism to cloak his own bestial desires in a holy word. 

So it's better to follow the Orthodox brahmachari model where you avoid temptation altogether (separated church and state) rather than test your will power (State interferes with each religion and you trust the politicians to be impartial while doing it).",2,5,1568299281.0,SandomRtranger1,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

I do not advocate separatism, but still I can you give an example.

At the time of independence, they'd have identified much more with them.
And you're right about Marathas and Sikhs or for that matter most princely states. A feeling of common belongingness was absolutely missing in most parts.

f008oa9,"Honestly the basic ingredients behind nationalism is the desire to be one. There are different theories about nationalism like:

Essentialism - Basically that the nation has always existed and has some sort of natural or organic existence. So a bit like the idea of the German nation and why it's called the third Reich. Essentially myth making about nationalism. 


Instrumentalism - Basically that it's an ideology used by elites to keep the citizens compliant. So nationalism has no organic or natural existence, it's just an idea fed to people. 


Modernisation - Liberal conception of nationalism where it didn't exist in pre modern times but nowadays with the advent of the Westphalian model along with ideas like secularism, democracy, sovereignty, industrialization etc also came the idea of the nation state. So it's not always present like the essentialism idea but also not something completely fake like the instrumentalist idea. 


Ultimately with all this confusion about the idea the best bet is to look at whether the people want to be a nation or not and don't worry about why the people want to be a nation. 

So imagine a Venn Diagram at the time if independence with the RSS supporters following the Sri Aurobindo or Vivekananda model where India is a nation because all follow the same culture but with unity in diversity. Don't worry that this model leaves out the North East. 

Then there's the liberals like Ambedkar who feel that India is a nation because after colonisation India has had 200+ years of shared polity where it has had the requisite experience of modernisation required to be a nation. Ambedkar felt that if the Constitution works then the nation building process would succeed with liberty, equality and fraternity. He was also pro Pakistan because he felt that unless Pakistan was created the communal strife would tear India apart. 

Then there's the various princely states who's rajas decided to accept the accession and get some personal benefits out of it rather than be conquered by India and forced to accede. I guess this is a good example for the instrumentalists. 

So in the Venn diagram the reason for them accepting nationalism will differ irrevocably but ultimately we only need focus on the intersection where all accept that India as a nation should be there. This could be called the overlapping consensus and the beauty of it is that we don't have to force our idea of why India is a nation on anyone as long as everyone accepts for their different reasons that India is a nation.",1,9,1568298686.0,SandomRtranger1,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral
