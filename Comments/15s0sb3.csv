Not every country gets to see Burj Khalifa lit up in the colours of their flag. Definitely a proud moment.

Ive lived in Dubai and whatever you say is complete BS except worker exploitation. But worker exploitation happens in India too, extreme hours, toxic environments are a thing here and also with garbage pay, atleast the money is better in dubai which is why most of them take a job in dubai because Indian labour laws are a joke and the pay is shit. When you can send 20x more and send back a lot to your family, why wouldnt you

Also funny you talk about 'Non existent human rights' in Dubai out of all the places. Bruh? Let me tell you being a minority is much much better in Dubai than being a minority in India. Tell me any instances of arabs in dubai going down the streets and beating up interfaith couples, beating up people for drinking and having pork and destroying churches. Ill wait. 

Also funny you mention Sharia and FrEEDom Of SPEech. Dude Dubai being a muslim country we can get pork and alcohol very easily without any hassle or moral policing. Can the same be done in india wrt to beef? Can an average citizen have beef in peace(cow meat not buffalo and the other shit you get) without getting lynched? Also funny you mention freedom of speech when india has blasphemy laws and comedians go to jail and gauri lankesh gets killed for expressing her FoS. You dont have unemployed vigilante groups like the Bajrang Dal over there. 

Im very sure you are confusing dubai with Saudi, but thats not the main point. Look at your own country in terms of dalit rights, minority rights and worker rights and then talk shit about other countries.

You seemed to have missed this very clear part of my comment:

> I wouldn't wish their conditions on anyone.

The point is not whether I'm OK with it or not; the point is that it is a choice they made willingly. Coal miners have to deal with similar gruelling conditions (in one's own country no less). Sewer divers, same thing. Etc.

Almost everyone has at least a phone of some sort, and either access to a TV, newspaper, or radio. And even if none of those apply, then they have access to social networks from which someone would tell them about what the conditions are like. You seem to be making some sort of moral statement about my or fellow Redditors' abilities to judge what sort of services people in poor and rural areas in the country have access to, but this is not what it's about. To think otherwise would be disingenuous, let alone ignoring facts.

The point is that while it sucks to have these jobs, they are choices, and somebody (or something) has gotta do them. As long as there are people willing to do them and nobody's forcing them to do it, it's fine (in the sense of freedom of choice). Saying that they were tricked or whatever is nonsense.
