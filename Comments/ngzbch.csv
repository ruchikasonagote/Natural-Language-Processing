""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera.""

This is irrelevant, just because value of your work is much more doesn't mean that you work harder than a physical labourer.

poverty. ""First and foremost, growth has directly created employment

government to begin new social schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi   
National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNERGA) and considerably expand existing ones.

India is not at all at the best place it could have been. But, since 2005, India has definitely seen a massive change in it's business culture and Entrepreneurs are getting more ambitious. For any country to move from ""Developing"" to ""Developed"" it needs strong MNC's that have a strong impact globally, so that it can bring back wealth to our country and increase income of Indians much more rapidly.

India still has a long way to go, but seeing the transition in Business culture in India does give me confidence that India can see massive economic improvement in the next few decades.

But what is widely accepted by economists world wide, is India has Improved a lot since 1991.
