It is universally recognised that if life is easy then people are more intelligent, more interested in technological innovation, they invent better things, invent ways to make life easier. That is why all ancient civilizations were formed on the banks of rivers, or in river valleys; because if humans have access to the basic necessities which made life easier at that time, they could sit down and think upon philosophical issues, invent new things, which they did, particularly new ways to tell time, and mapping the sky. If people prospered and forged an empire, then they sent their people to map the world. The spirit of discovery, the very basis of modern civilization arises from the fact that people had the luxury of settling down at one place and thriving, thinking about their future generations. 

On the other hand, the barbarians of the European steppes and Central Asia only knew of a few fundamental things, only followed a few rules in order to survive: you kill anything that threatens you, you fuck women in order to gain more children who can help you hunt and you worship a God who will give you strength in battle. Because you believe that God controls the weather, so you pray to God to protect you from harsh winter. That's it.

When someone talks about Christianity and their associated Fathers and nuns, its all about helping people and stuff. When we talk about Hinduism, its thoughts, beliefs, rishis, yogis and practices have brought immense benefits to its followers in terms of leading a life. It is true that these do not directly bring any technical achivements or scientific progress. But they do bring significant impact in leading a life. Another interesting example will be that of Muslims and their Quran. While people can have immense progress in science and technology, its only because of the words in Quran that a religious Muslim does not consume liquor.

As I interact with more people, I realize that the culture around is important in achiveing something. UP's tableau is a reflection of our past culture of knowledge, teachers, teaching and a dharmic of leading a life. Come to think of it, India's past scientific progress was by similar gurus in Aryabhata and Sushruta.

I'm going to need a source for that. Much of the revolutionary mathematical concepts we see today like Calculus, Cartesian system and Number Theory are given by Europeans.

Historically, Catholics are numbered among the most important scientists of all time, including Rene Descartes, who discovered analytic geometry and the laws of refraction; Blaise Pascal, inventor of the adding machine, hydraulic press, and the mathematical theory of probabilities; Augustinian priest Gregor Mendel, who founded modern genetics; Louis Pasteur, founder of microbiology and creator of the first vaccine for rabies and anthrax; and cleric Nicolaus Copernicus, who first developed scientifically the view that the earth rotated around the sun.  Jesuit priests in particular have a long history of scientific achievement; they

contributed to the development of pendulum clocks, pantographs, barometers, reflecting telescopes and microscopes, to scientific fields as various as magnetism, optics and electricity.  They observed, in some cases before anyone else, the colored bands on Jupiter's surface, the Andromeda nebula and Saturn's rings.  They theorized about the circulation of the blood (independently of Harvey), the theoretical possibility of flight, the way the moon affected the tides, and the wave-like nature of light.  Star maps of the southern hemisphere, symbolic logic, flood-control measures on the Po and Adige rivers, introducing plus and minus signs into Italian mathematics — all were typical Jesuit achievements, and scientists as influential as Fermat, Huygens, Leibniz and Newton were not alone in counting Jesuits among their most prized correspondents.

>!Issac Newton was a Practising Christian and Himself wrote in Principia Mathematica that God is The Ultimate Cause of Everything.

Argument from authority. It's a logical fallacy, look it up. 

Newton's contribution towards science and maths were driven by the European culture, not religion. That's what my original comment was about. 

>!Don't forget Neils Bohr(Taoist), Werner Heisenberg(Had conversation with Aurbindo Ghosh, a prominent Hindu Philosopher) Schrodinger (Named his dog 'Atman' and himself wrote many times in his notes that The Upanishads are the best).

Again, argument from authority. Also, having open discussions with religious philosophers doesn't mean you subscribe to the religion itself. 

>!Einstein himself was a fan of Religious Philosophies.

He clarified however that, ""I am not an atheist"", preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a religious nonbeliever. Einstein also stated he did not believe in life after death, adding ""one life is enough for me."" He was closely involved in his lifetime with several humanist groups.

gl7qy74," If the Catholic Church were opposed to science, we would expect to find no or very few Catholic scientists, no sponsorship of scientific research by Catholic institutions, and an explicit distrust of reason in general and scientific reasoning in particular taught in official Catholic teaching.  In fact, we find none of these things.
Historically, Catholics are numbered among the most important scientists of all time, including Rene Descartes, who discovered analytic geometry and the laws of refraction; Blaise Pascal, inventor of the adding machine, hydraulic press, and the mathematical theory of probabilities; Augustinian priest Gregor Mendel, who founded modern genetics; Louis Pasteur, founder of microbiology and creator of the first vaccine for rabies and anthrax; and cleric Nicolaus Copernicus, who first developed scientifically the view that the earth rotated around the sun.  Jesuit priests in particular have a long history of scientific achievement; they

contributed to the development of pendulum clocks, pantographs, barometers, reflecting telescopes and microscopes, to scientific fields as various as magnetism, optics and electricity.  They observed, in some cases before anyone else, the colored bands on Jupiter's surface, the Andromeda nebula and Saturn's rings.  They theorized about the circulation of the blood (independently of Harvey), the theoretical possibility of flight, the way the moon affected the tides, and the wave-like nature of light.  Star maps of the southern hemisphere, symbolic logic, flood-control measures on the Po and Adige rivers, introducing plus and minus signs into Italian mathematics — all were typical Jesuit achievements, and scientists as influential as Fermat, Huygens, Leibniz and Newton were not alone in counting Jesuits among their most prized correspondents. [1]

The scientist credited with proposing in the 1930s what came to be known as the ""Big Bang theory"" of the origin of the universe was Georges Lemaitre, a Belgian physicist and Roman Catholic priest.  Alexander Fleming, the inventor of penicillin, shared his faith.  More recently, Catholics constitute a good number of Nobel Laureates in Physics, Medicine, and Physiology, including Erwin Schrodinger, John Eccles, and Alexis Carrel.  How can the achievements of so many Catholics in science be reconciled with the idea that the Catholic Church opposes scientific knowledge and progress?
One might try to explain such distinguished Catholic scientists as rare individuals who dared to rebel against the institutional Church, which opposes science.  However, the Catholic Church as an institution funds, sponsors, and supports scientific research in the Pontifical Academy of Science and in the departments of science found in every Catholic university across the world, including those governed by Roman Catholic bishops, such as The Catholic University of America.  This financial and institutional support of science by the Church began at the very birth of science in seventeenth-century Europe and continues today.  Even Church buildings themselves were not only used for religious purposes but designed in part to foster scientific knowledge.  As Thomas Woods notes:

Cathedrals in Bologna, Florence, Paris, and Rome were designed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to function as world-class solar observatories.  Nowhere in the world were there more precise instruments for the study of the sun.  Each such cathedral contained holes through which sunlight could enter and time lines (or meridian lines) on the floor.  It was by observing the path traced out by the sunlight on these lines that researchers could obtain accurate measurements of time and predict equinoxes. [2]

In the words of J. L. Heilbron of the University of California, Berkeley, the ""Roman Catholic Church gave more financial aid and social support to the study of astronomy over six centuries, from the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages into the Enlightenment, than any other, and probably, all other institutions.""  [3] This financial and social support extended also to other branches of scientific inquiry.",1,5,1611911050.0,GCB77,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

The Black Plague also resulted in severe depopulation and some immediate economic decline. However, with the extreme loss of life there was an overabundance of goods, a decrease in their price, a surplus of jobs and consequently a rise in wages. The standard of living actually increased. Also the need for paid workers resulted in movement away from feudalism and the development of a working class. *All of these events paved the way for the coming Renaissance.*

Another well documented case is that of ""Guru Matsyendranath"" the Guru of ""Guru Gorakshnath"" who entered into the dead body of a dead king and started enjoying life as the king and forgot his previous existence. It is only when Guru Gorakshnath reminded his Guru by turning himself into a women that this world is a myth and he must remove himself from the attachments of life. 
He also influenced muslim who became known as Muslim Yogis who even these days sing about lord Shiva and Guru Gorakshnath.

Of course I did. The source was a single web page. No in-depth research, no verification of claims. One of the claims in the webpage is that society shifted away from feudalism and towards a working class during that time period, which is what led to the Renaissance. This is a blatantly wrong fact, as feudalism was still rampant during and after the Renaissance. The working class was established during the Industrial Revolution.

>How does that change shit?

Of course it changes everything. Every major ancient civilization was established in a river basin. Near a water source. There were no major civilizations in ancient times in Europe, just a horde of Germanic tribes (nothing to do with modern Germany) going around pillaging and looting everyone. Civilizations in Europe arose due to the establishment of Christianity. The Anglo-Saxon tribes came together under the banner of Christianity to form Albion, which later became England. Europeans are not some advanced species. They are a bunch of barbarians who are rich today because they have systematically looted civilizations in Africa, China, Japan and Indian subcontinent.

>characterized by urban development

What urban development happened in Renaissance Europe? London, Florence, Venice, Hamburg etc they were all cities long before the Renaissance, long after the Renaissance ended.

>new system of communication (like writing)

Again, I don't know what new system of communication was invented in Renaissance Europe. Educated people had begun writing on paper long before the Renaissance (Gutenberg Bible, Coverdale Bible, Tyndale Bible, Piers Plowman, Canterbury Tales etc). They wrote on paper even after that.

>Where the fuck did you get your definition?

I think our understanding of what a civilization is varies greatly. Let's just agree to disagree.

>Greece was once part of the Roman Empire.

Holy shit. Seriously? I was reading your points and trying to understand your views, but this one sentence alone is enough. 

Really? The Greek civilisation was part of the Roman Empire? That is like saying Ashoka's Empire was once part of the Mughal Empire. There was almost nothing similar between the Greek and Roman civilizations. The Romans didn't even keep the names of the Greek gods and goddesses. Zeus became Jupiter, Ares became Mars, Hades became Pluto etc. The political system of the Greek city-states was based upon democracy. No king or queen, no Lord. The Roman civilization was more or less entirely ruled by emperors. Two different triumvirates, Nero, Caligula, Commodus, Diocletian, Hadrian etc. Most of whom were cruel dictators.

1)The first major word is *allowing*. Except in the case of illegal prostitution, women/men give CONSENT first. This is their choice. You can’t do jack shit about it now.

( Austria). Tell me for a second do you agree with this? Do you want some lecherous man go to this country and use the body of a child to quench his lust if prostitution become legal all around the world?
Someone replied in this same thread to me that sex work  is not immoral to him. Would he be morally content allowing a 50 year old man have sex with a 14 year old girl if it becomes legal? 
Don't you think misogynistic, lustful men will not  pay government to change consent laws to ever lower than that of 14? I:e lobbying
Aren't you afraid that young poor girl in some places could easily be manipulated to sell their bodies to such men under the veil of consent? Or some young girls may be attracted to the money and sell their bodies to such men?

gl7k0p7,"Good. This is cherry-picking now

The general age of consent in Austria is 14, as specified by Section 206[7] of the penal code. (The term unmündig is specified in Section 74[8] of the penal code.) Paragraph 4 of Section 206 defines a close-in-age exception, lowering the age of consent to 13 if the other party is not older than 16 and some additional conditions are met. Paragraph 4 of Article 207 increases this exception to 4 years, with a minimum age of 12, for sexual acts not amounting to sexual intercourse or other acts “that can be equated with sexual intercourse” - essentially non-penetrative sexual contact. It is subject to the same additional conditions of article 206 (for example, that the act does not cause serious bodily harm).

However, Section 207b[9] of the penal code contains an exception to the general age of consent: if one of the partners is younger than 16 years of age and ""not sufficiently mature to understand the significance of the act"", then the act is punishable.

The offence ""initiating sexual contacts with minors under 14 through the use of computer system"" is punishable by two years' imprisonment (Section 208a Penal Code).
