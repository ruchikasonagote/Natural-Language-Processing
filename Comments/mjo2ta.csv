gtbsyhg,"Oh boy! Time to [repost](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/igz8lm/casteblind_indians/g2xowip/) a comment I guess. Too many uninformed opinions flying around.

###Denial of caste based discrimination because ""mY sT FrIeND oWnS A cAR"" will not be tolerated here. Keep this in mind.

Let me blatantly copy a gigantic post made by /u/AllAgTCups. The post was a bit long, so **I had to split it into 3 comments**. 

Some statistics regarding caste and the disparity between the ""upper"" and the ""lower"" castes.

Using the [NSS 2012](http://mospi.nic.in/sites/default/files/national_data_bank/pdf/NSS_68Round-563.pdf) survey data, the population % of these social groups were :

|Social group|Population %|
|:-|:-|
|SC|18.8|
|ST|8.7|
|OBC|44|
|General category/Others|28.5|

According [this study](https://socy.umd.edu/sites/socy.umd.edu/files/pubs/Thorat%20and%20Joshi%202019_The%20Continuning%20Practice%20of%20Untouchability%20in%20India.pdf), about 52% of Brahmins and 24% of Forward castes practice untouchilbilty, not surprising that some of them end up bringing their casteism even abroad, even for educated Brahmins and Forward castes, who recieved some post-grad education, 48% and 27% respectively practiced untouchilbilty.

For the voting in the 2019 elections,

About 61% of the the general category voted for the NDA, while the average vote for it was 45%. [Source](https://www.indiatoday.in/diu/story/how-india-voted-2019-lok-sabha-election-india-today-axis-my-india-poll-1539617-2019-05-31). 

Regarding representation in media,

Of the 121 newsroom leadership positions – editor-in-chief, managing editor, executive editor, bureau chief, input/output editor – across the newspapers, TV news channels, news websites, and magazines under study, 106 are occupied by upper castes, five by other backward classes and six by people from minority communities. The caste of four individuals could not be identified.

1. Three out of every four anchors (among a total of 40 anchors in Hindi channels and 47 in English channels) of debates are upper caste. Not one is Dalit, Adivasi, or OBC
2. For over 70% of their primetime debate shows, news channels draw the majority of the panellists from the upper castes
3. No more than 5% of all articles in English newspapers are written by Dalits and Adivasis. Hindi newspapers fare slightly better at around 10%
4. Around 72% of bylined articles on news websites are written by people from the upper castes
5. Only 10 of the 972 articles featuring on the cover pages of the 12 magazines under study are about issues related to caste.

According to [this](https://www.newslaundry.com/2019/08/02/caste-representation-indian-newsrooms-report-media-rumble-oxfam-india)

1. About 89% of leadership positions in English TV news channels belonged to the general category.
2. About 76% of flagship show anchors belong to the general category.
3. Only 5.6% and 1% of panellists across the surveyed channels belong to SC and ST categories respectively
4. For Hindi news channels 100% of leadership belonged to the general category and 80% of the anchors in primetime shows
5. On discussion of caste issues, 69% of the panellists belonged to the general category across all the surveyed channels.
6. Out of the 16,000 articles written by English newspapers between October 2018 and March 2019, about 60% were written by ""upper""-caste writers.
7. In Hindi newspapers, 56% of writers belonged to the general category, 8.1% to SC and 1.1% to ST categories.
8. Among digital media outlets, 84% of all leadership positions were occupied by those belonging to general category.
9. Articles regarding caste issues in digital media, 56% were written by those from general category.
10. Among magazines, 56% of total output come from general category writers 6.5% from SC/ST combined and 17 % from OBC category.

There is under-representation of Dalits in judiciary. According to [this](https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/india-news-70-years-of-indian-judiciary-opinion-composition-terribly-skewed-higher-levels-bastion-of-upper-caste-males/302658)

In the past 70 years, India only had just ONE Dalit Chief Justice. Currently there are no Dalit Chief Justice in high courts. According to [this](https://www.legallyindia.com/supreme-court/judiciary-remains-a-major-brahmin-bastion-no-sc-st-judge-has-been-elevated-to-apex-court-in-7-years-20180124-9045), no SC/ST person has been elevated to the supreme court in the past 7 years or now we can say 9 years since that was written in 2018.

In corporate also there is under representation, [93%](https://theprint.in/opinion/annihilate-of-caste-in-indian-corporate-possible-but-firms-must-say-dalit-lives-matter/444244/) of Indian cooperate board members belong to the ""forward""-castes, out of which Brahmins make up 45% and Vaishyas make up about 46%.

Similarly qualified SC candidates are less likely to be hired than the general category ones. [This](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40276548?seq=1) study shows that those with Dalit sounding names are 33% less likely to be hired and with Muslim sounding name are 67% less likely to be hired than someone ""upper""-caste sounding name.

There is also a huge income disparity by caste, for SC/ST people, their income is almost half of that of forward-castes. [Source](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Bharti2018.pdf) (page 17) Wealth/assets here is the indicator of presennce of 33 different durable household goods like TV, air conditioner etc.

|Social group|Household income (in Rs./year)|Wealth/Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|
|SC|89,356|12.7|
|ST|75,216|10.2|
|OBC|1,04,099|14.7|

In terms of percentiles in wealth index by caste. ([NFHS 2015-16](http://rchiips.org/NFHS/NFHS-4Reports/India.pdf), pg 31)

|Social group|0-20 (Poorest quntile)|20-40|40-60|60-80|80-100 (Richest quintile)|

|OBC|18.2|19.6|21.1|22.3|18.8|
|Other|9.4|15.4|18.4|22.8|34.0|

A score of greater than 20 means, there is larger representation of a social group in that quintile than overall for India. You can see the ""lower""-caste have a higher representation in the poorer quntiles. We can see that 50.1% and 70.7% and of the SC and ST households respectively are in the two poorest quintiles.

The overall wealth/asset [share](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/upper-caste-hindus-richest-in-india-own-41-total-assets-says-study-on-wealth-distribution-5582984/) of India's wealth is [heavily](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Wealth-Ownership-and-Inequality-in-India%3A-A-Tagade-Naik/79bd81b0ff05baea522755603a7bda6d5b403be5) concentrated among ""upper""-caste Hindus.

We do see a lot of caste discrimination in rural areas even today. Don't forget this happens in urban areas as well. 

My family got a site which was completely surrounded by upper caste people. We had a huge issues to build house there (they just don't want an lower caste to stay among them , probably because we eat non veg??) 


Housekeeper asked us if we are Dalits as she doesn't want to work in lower caste ppl house (she eats non veg as well so it's not an issue with cleaning those utensils) 

Once people get to know caste in business world it's a misconception that lower caste are lazy and have come to this level because of reservations or other schemes. 

And obviously the last inter-caste marriage.

My supervisor was Indian; this story aside, he was a good guy, and made a point of thanking me for my help.

gtbodz6,"Will just say 3 things to my fellow UC's here -

1. The government is not a corporate, it is not a company trying to maximize its profits. There is no overarching merit goal that it needs to achieve at the end of the year. On the other, the government is the vehicle of democracy, and what makes a democracy is representation. So a government doesnt give 2 fucks about merits and profits like a corporate, it was made and given its powers to ensure representation in society. 
2. Brahmins have enjoyed 100 percent reservation in attaining education for 3000 years, surely our society owes some reparations to those that were denied it. These 3000 years have created hegemonies in society, look around yourself, what surnames do you find in movies, the directors of your colleges, sports players, CEO's, billionaires. Can you deny the Brahmin baniya hegemony in society? Can you deny the social and cultural capital UC's enjoy like the know how of money, networks, lobbying. Remember all these surnames you find around you represent the 15 percent and not the 85 percent.
3. Finally, try to understand what reservation is : The govt is simply stating that in public sector(2 percent jobs) at least I want 50 percent representation of 85 percent of the population. Thats all its asking, govt is only saying that for the tiny amount of undertakings that the democratic govt is undertaking, it wants to ensure at least 50 percent representation of the 85 percent population. Is that too much to ask? Is that really discriminatory the 15 percent? Ask yourself. 98 percent of jobs are not in public sector, so many businesses by baniya marwaris only hire people from there own communities, that is 98 percent.

Finally for the UC's asking that the reservations be given to poor LC's that the BMW LC's, I'm all with you, poor LC's should get reservations but also why not have reservations in the private sector as well, when will we see LC's on leading positions at the top and not just as tokens and puppets like our president. You want to offer help to the poor dalits go ahead please do, but just show us what system you will make for dalits to become heads of state and CEO's. How will you ensure that the system will not only benefit the poor UC's. Just show us the correct way and show us that it will work and we're down for it.

gtbknib,"Since a lot of people on this thread are harping on about economic inequity

B R Ambedkar : *“while the privileges (for Brahmins) have gone, the advantages derived from their continuance over several centuries have remained.”* To understand reservations is to recognise the entrenched nature of casteism in Indian societies and the accumulation of Brahminical (and Savarna) privilege through the blood, sweat, tears, and humiliation of marginalised groups over centuries of exploitation. By shifting the focus from social injustice to one of economic inequity, we essentially erase the pernicious effects of everyday casteism. It then becomes a question of economics (whether neo-liberal or old school state socialism) rather than an interrogation of our deep-seated casteist mindsets and unconscious biases towards those whom we are trained and taught to see as different and, often, lesser than us.

* Are Dalits poor? A vast majority are. There are several exceptions 
* *Is Reservation Bad?* Not totally. It has helped millions of families climb up the economic ladder and will continue to do so. Some abuse it, so better targeting needed
* *Are some Brahmins casteist Assholes?* Yep.
* *Are* ***only*** *Brahmins casteist Assholes?* Nope. Caste system arranges groups in a social ladder. Every group looks down upon the groups ""beneath"" it. This is true to UC, OBC, SC/ ST.
* *Are* ***all*** *Brahmins casteist Assholes?* Not even close. There are several reformers who fought against untouchability especially during the Independence movement. 
* *Do poor Brahmins need help?* In my opinion yes. 
* *Is there nuance to this?* Yes. But by labeling the groups without realizing allies/ assholes helps to further caste divide and keep vote bank politics alive. So lets stroke casteism close to elections and conveniently forget it till next time.

gtc3kch,"Where do we hear about caste the most? It is in debates sorrounding reservations in higher education and government employment. Even here the main subject is how the upper castes are discriminated against and not about the atrocities faced by lower castes and why they need reservation.

The truth is that upper caste never experience caste as discrimination or a disadvantage. They mistake their caste privilege for merit and starts whining the first instance they face some form of disadvantage because of their upper caste status. For lower castes it is the exact opposite. They experience caste and caste based discrimination on a daily basis. For them caste is an everyday reality everywhere they go.

Caste based reservation is for sure discriminatory, but it is necessary positive discrimination whose positives far outweigh the negatives. Upper castes experience caste (or disadvantage due to caste) for the first time in their lives when they go for education or employment in public institutions and they can't tolerate the fact that they are in a way receiving the treatment they gave to Dalits for thousands of years. They feel that it is unjust while forgetting the history of injustice. They forget that what they call merit is basically built on caste capital and oppression of Dalits and the so called lack of merit among lower castes was created by upper castes over centuries of oppression.

gtbm7g5,"A lot of folks here are conflating the two issues - caste discrimination and economic deprivation. They are both separate issues and need to be tackled differently. Caste reservations are meant to deal with the former.

World over, there are women's reservations in universities, government seats and in some organizations even in the management board. This is done to increase the representation of women in these places since women have been discriminated against for long. Would it make sense to say, let's only reserve these for poor women? No. It doesn't have to do with poverty; it has to do with discrimination on the basis of gender. Similarly, for the lower castes.

For people who believe that caste discrimination doesn't exist anymore or only in rural areas, they're mistaken. I personally know of people in who will not rent out their apartment to lower caste people, some who won't allow their lower caste maid to enter their kitchen, some who keep a separate utensil for them, some who will specifically ask your surname to check which caste you belong to (something I have personally experienced since I'm married to a Bengali brahmin) and give a look of approval when they come to know you're upper caste too. And these are well-educated people living in cities like Bangalore, Bombay, etc. 

There could be ways to improve the system, I agree. It would be interesting to see some data from the past so many years to verify the benefits of caste reservations to figure out how it can be improved, and also some awareness campaigns and studies to see how perceptions of people have changed over the years.

for general quota, you need to get 199 (for cs) and 197 (for bio) cutoff marks in order to get into the top government college in my state, but for ST it's 160/170 and even for MBC it's around 185-190

and fun fact: 70% of ALL SEATS in universities affiliated with my state government are fuckin reserved 🗿🗿🗿
even the leftover 30% is in ""open competition"" which can be claimed by a dude from any caste. what the fuck am I supposed to do bruh? im poor as fuck and I have no way out. how is this fair you ask? you prolly won't ask so I won't bother answering

anyway the college in question is the best among our state, it's really sweet and cheap as fuck (which my family could really motherfucking use) and good quality as well 

and man, I fuckin got 190/200 (95 in pcm and 98 in cs). 
I also got 93 percentile in jee mains and barely cleared it. most groups can get by with 80, and ST can slide in with 35 🗿. if you aren't familiar with the percentile system, you prolly have zero clue how fuckin messed up this is. 

your rank drops by fucking 10 THOUSAND if your percentile lowers by *EVEN ONE*. so yes ofc it pisses me off if a guy who got 70 is carefree and I'm in despair. 
you can kiss your iit dreams goodbye lmao, naive little fuckers in class8 gonna get their hearts crushed for sure. aight I'm getting off topic

anyway, bottomline I ain't a salty dumbass okay, I got some good fuckin marks. so how much fucking more ya want me to get? they offered me civil or some shit for all this hard work🗿

in the end I joined VIT (which is one of the top institutes too albeit private) with category 1 fee criteria, which is purely based on merit (jee + board marks) 

I mean yea I'm fuckin proud but even category 1 costs 5 times as much as the other college I was talking about 

guess I'll go fuck myself now. I may sound heartless or whatever, but I really am not. I ain't ignoring caste problems, but what am I supposed to do if I want to get into the college I want? 199/200 in CBSE is simply fuckin impossible.

gtbt12i,"So, it's clearly not an even playing field. So, take for examples studying for entrances for which you need books which can be quite expensive. It's highly likely that an equally smart and hardworking reserved category student will likely score lesser marks than an non-reserved category due to their conditions like being denied education or not having the money to buy the books or attend the classes.

The coaching classes for such entrance exams in medical institutions often have fees greater than Rs. 1 lakh/year and the books can cost thousands of rupees it disproportionately favours the rich and according to [PLFS(Periodic Labour Force Survey)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/how-much-do-the-salaried-really-earn-here-are-the-most-detailed-findings-yet/articleshow/70599591.cms) in 2017-18,

1. About 45% of regular workers earned less than Rs. 10,000/month.
2. About 12% of regular workers earned less than Rs. 5,000/month.
3. About 3% of regular workers earned between Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1,00,000/month.
4. About 0.2% of regular workers earned more than Rs. 1,00,000/month.

We can clearly see that joining these classes favours the richest quintiles in which ""upper""-castes are over represented, leaving behind students from reserved categories. Combining with they discrimination that these students on the basis of their caste, we need reservations to create an even playing field, because even with the same income, the discrimination on the basis of their caste still exists.

Reservations is only applicable to govt jobs which make up a tiny percentage of total jobs in the country.

Here's the level of education of those 15 years old and above by caste.

|Social group|Not literate (%)|Upto primary (%)|Middle (%)|Secondary (%)|Higher secondary (%)|Diploma (%)|Graduate (%)|Post graduate and above (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ST|42.7|24.3|15.5|8.5|5.3|0.5|2.5|0.6|
|SC|39.0|23.2|16.4|10.8|6.1|0.7|2.9|0.8|

|Overall|30.2|21.1|16.6|13.9|8.8|1.3|6.2|2.0|

Here, we can see that we can see SC/ST people have lower rates of education. About 82.5% of ST and 78.6% SC people have either middle school or less than middle school education, while for others it is 54.1%. For having education either higher secondary or above that, it  8.9% for ST and 10.5% for SC and 28.8% for others. It's about triple the rate of SC/ST people.

As it pointed out [here](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scheduled-castes-among-worst-sufferers-of-india-s-job-problem/story-Qh0hyHy9UUTg1cIOpi5l2K.htm), according to 2011-12 NSSO statistics, the share of casual wage labourers by caste, the share wage labourers among SC was 63%, for OBC it was 44%, FC it was 42% and 46% for other groups. For causal wage labourers, the share for 47% while for it was about 33% for OBC/FC/Others. This signfies more job insecurity and poor earnings. For the total share of causal labourers in the country, 32% of them were SC, while they make up about 16% of the population. And also according to a survey

>The survey was carried out among 1992 households in 80 villages across the states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in 2013. A study of 441 farm wage labourers, indicates that about 41 per cent were denied work by the high castes due to caste prejudice. Of these, about 76 percent in grain harvesting, 20 percent in vegetable cultivation and 12 percent in drying of grains and chilly and 11 percent in domestic work were denied jobs, due to ‘polluting status’ of the untouchables.

Even among the similar type of jobs SC/ST people have lower monthly per-capita consumer expenditure (MPCE), indicating higher poverty. Here's MPCE (In Rs) by social group and type of jobs. ([Source](http://mospi.nic.in/sites/default/files/national_data_bank/pdf/NSS_68Round-562.pdf), page 17)

This [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-013-0152-z) talks about the difference in wages due to labor market discrimination. Although it uses different data set. But that different data set also found a difference between the wages SC/ST and non-SC/ST. In rural areas, 62% of the difference in wages is due to endowment or explanied component and 38% is due to labor market discrimination, while for urban areas it is 69% due endowments and 31% due to labor market discrimination, the difference in endowments is due to different education and location. The [share](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/the-geography-of-caste-in-urban-india-1569564507580.html) of SC/ST according to 2011 census in the six biggest cities,   New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru is 11.25% combined, while their combined population in the country is about 25% and that too they are concentrated on the most underdeveloped areas of these cities, where there is lack of basic amenities like piped water and toilets. So, many live in villeges, where there is underdeveloped infrastructure, combined with social discrimination, affecting their access to quality education.

gwseoj7,"It doesn't even matter if you have a high educational status or standard of living. 

To me, I detached the whole notion of casteism in my family when I discussed early in my family that I wouldn't take the official family surname because my caste background should have no bearing on the kind of person I will become tomorrow. It wasn't something on my radar.

However, the earliest encounter of casteism I encountered was in my school when someone used it as slur, just based on my father's name. It didn't affect me then. 

Second time was in college when an upper caste Hindu (a peer at my startup) told me during an official negotiation with the college authorities that I wouldn't be able to convince the authorities for signing a contract, and he should go, because he comes from a lineage of business oriented caste community and it's in his blood, rather than ""me"".

This is the kind of casual casteism, air of superiority and accepted colored/racial differences in an educated society is what is holding us back.

For reference, I graduated from a TIER 1 engineering college in India and Tier 1 B-school in US later, and look ""pretty unconventional"" by their percieved frame of reference of a low caste guy, so it isn't even the go-to response of most people usually when they strike a conversation. (6""2, 180 pound, lighter shade, hazel brown eyes with good communication skills)

Traditionally, one would have to go out of their way to be an extra douche, and there have been those instances.

In union cabinets, the ""upper-middle""-caste had share of 87.7%, the share for SC was just 4.6%. The average age of death for Dalit woman is 14.6 years less than ""upper""-caste woman. Even after taking into other condition like drinking and sanitation, the average of death for Dalit woman is still lesser. The life expectancy of a Dalit woman is still 11 years lower. [Source](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/on-average-a-dalit-woman-dies-14-years-younger-than-one-from-upper-caste-un-report/)

>“Even after accounting for social status differences, a gap of 5.48 years remains between the average age of death of higher caste women and Dalit women,” the UN report notes. “Further, the authors \[of the 2013 study\] applied the levels of mortality-related factors catalogued for higher caste women and found that there is still a gap between the life expectancy for higher caste women and Dalit women. A difference of 11.07 years remains even after attributing the Dalit social status coefficient to higher caste women. This means that life expectancy among Dalit women is 11 years lower than that of higher caste women despite experiencing identical social conditions like sanitation and drinking water.”

Even outside India, there is castiesm is still there and Dalits experience casteism from the ""upper""-castes there.

According to [this article](https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-03-08/us-isn-t-safe-trauma-caste-bias), it says that only 1.5% of Indian immigrants in USA were SC/ST and more than 90% were from the ""upper""-castes, but they are only around 25-30% of India's population, although this data is from 2003 and according to [this report](https://www.equalitylabs.org/caste-in-the-united-states),

1. 25% of the Dalit respondents said they had faced verbal abuse on the basis of their caste.
2. 1 in 3 reported being discriminated against their education.
3. 2 in 3 Dalits reported being treated unfairly at the work place.
4. 60% Dalits report experiencing caste-based derogatory jokes
5. 40% of Dalits and 14% Shudras were made to feel unwelcome at their place of worship due to their caste.
6. 20% of Dalit respondents discriminated at a place of business due to their caste
7. Over 40% of Dalit respondents have reported being rejected in Romantic Partnership on the basis of caste.
8. 1 in 2 Dalits and 1 in 4 Shudras live in fear of their caste being outed.

So, it's not surprising that a lot of them brought their casteism even to USA considering that the demographics that migrate there, likely to be wealthy ""upper""-caste, A group where there is a high proportion of chaddis and also those with castiest views. This not only make Indians look bad and gives ammo to those with racist anti-immigrant agendas, but it also make the lives of SC/ST people, who came there, even worse, now they can't even escape from castiesm there.

Part of the problem is the lack of dignity of labour. Apart from caste, Indians have a huge bias about how certain jobs/tasks are perceived. For example, trade jobs like plumbers and electricians are looked down upon. Only white collar jobs command any respect. The society is so hierarchical at every level. This bias is much lower in the west.

gtcamc5,"Your ""caste"" is linked to basically your family, which in turn is determined by your patrilineal last name.

Furthermore, upper castes have ""family ledgers"" with priests (either at their ancestral home, or at a religious place like Haridwar) which are akin to family trees; and so, it becomes even more difficult to *impersonate* a different caste.

While it is true that a person can legally change the name, including last name; most Indians are extremely tied to their family structure; and rarely venture out of their homes; which places them at a greater disadvantage when it comes to social mobility.

Everything from knowledge to keys to the kingdom was hereditary and as a result over time, roles in society also became hereditary. Merchants passed down their trade to next generations, farmers, trades people, etc all passed down their roles and knowledge to the progeny.

Yes discrimination never stops and continuing reservation is only adding to that as fuel. Most people are becoming well off now and seeing a bunch of them get special benefits from when they were not so well off makes people feel cheated which is taken out on those getting the benefits.


Anyone who is financially well off does NOT deserve any reservation.

Of course, our great ministers ( DALIT AND NON-DALIT BOTH) saw this as an opportunity, did not uplift people and kept on using this as a vote bank. So yeah, folks who are financially well off do not deserve reservation. If you are supporting this, you are naive in thinking that well off dalits do not abuse their reservation. 

Getting bashed for talking general seats is there. I never disagree to that, but that is the sole reason for getting uplifted all and removing the reservation.

gtcm4yc,"We had a similar system here in Europe during the middle ages with the separation of nobles, peasants, and clergy. There were also different ranks of nobles like counts, dukes, kings, etc. and similar distinctions existed in the lower class, for example between craftsmen, farmers, and paupers, or between citizens and non-citizens in cities. While pretty much everybody could become clergy (although your career prospects most likely still depended on your family background and wealth), and there was some mobility in the lower classes, nobility was mostly determined at birth. Although especially later on you could be awarded a lower-ranked, often non-hereditary noble title like becoming a knight for certain military achievements or through enough wealth, after the rise of big merchant and banking families. And in general, the highest-ranking nobles like kings or emperor's probably had a decent amount of freedom in giving out titles. Though there was a bit of a difference in that usually only the firstborn son obtained the title of the father with all others becoming lower-ranked nobles, leading to a dilution over time with many people nowadays having an aristocratic ancestor somewhere in their family tree (although ofc it doesn't technically count if it's via a maternal line). The same or course also often applied to the lower classes where usually only the eldest inherited the farm or shop of the father.

There still exist some descendants of aristocratic families nowadays who often still have a good amount of land, wealth and influence and consider themselves actual aristocrats and especially in countries like the UK they are ofc still an actual part of society but as you might know, nowadays even members of the royal family are able to marry commoners so it's clearly losing its relevance. Here in Germany, at least to the government, aristocratic titles are merely a part of your name, so your last name might simply be ""Graf von Irgendwo"" i.e. ""count of somewhere"". In Austria, they even completely abolished aristocratic titles and it's forbidden to have them as part of your name (according to Wikipedia). Pretty much all of the exclusivity around aristocracy that still exists here simply comes from the former nobles themselves and through money. If somebody here on the street told people they're some nobel and tried to use their status for anything, maybe some people might find it cool, but most likely they'd just get laughed at.

But it certainly took a long time for all of this to happen, with things like the French revolution and the World Wars being deciding factors here in Germany and France. Countries like Spain, the UK, and a few others still have Kings and Queens as formal heads of state, even if they are also slowly losing their relevance more and more and ofc don't have any actual governing power.",14,3,1617546774.0,1vader,1617560222.0,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

Long ago, India as it is now, never existed. The subcontinent was more like a mixture or amalgamation of different prosperous and rich kingdoms ruled by King's and emperors.  At that time, it was necessary to classify and differentiate ppl within each kingdom and the only easy and logical method to do this was by their profession. So, ppl who worked as black smiths and other such smiths were called ""Acharis"", those that did manual labour were called ""shudras"", those who did business were called ""Vaishyas"", the warriors were called ""Kshatriyas"" and those who served the Lord, worked at temples were called ""Brahmins"". This system was never started as a means of discrimination, rather merely served as a purpose to differentiate and identify the ppl within a kingdom so that levying taxes became easier too. So, anyone from any of these categories could essentially move to another class system of profession. A Brahmin could technically become a Kshatriya or a Vaishya and vice versa. Similar for the others as well. 

However, over time, what gradually started happening with population increase was ppl started distinguishing by birth. So, a Shudra's son or daughter also came to be considered as a shudra. brahmin's kids were brahmins as well and so on. This was also the time when money started playing a very important role in everyone's lives. Communities slowly began to not cooperate with one another that much and religion became the priority, with everything being looked wt, from a religious pov. Then came the Colonial era (eventually) and the Brits misused and often ill-treated that community of ppl who were skilled in the blue collar jobs and those who revolted against their oppressive rule. A feeling of low esteem and inferiority complex eventually started setting in and it was also around this time that the colonial rule started distinguishing our ppl based on our skin colour. This oppressive colonial rule lasted for 200 years and natural, you can as well imagine the impact it had, on our ppl.

gtcq3pv,"Bhau, 😁 I have seen that it's very hard to change mentality of others, which is why I think that removing the barriers that caste system possess, and they are MENTAL barriers, boundaries and divisions created by the people of the past, it is an old system which has persisted for many years and is a blot on the nation of India. Why did people consider ABC as one sort of caste and XYZ as another sort? because his parents were so-and-so so he/she will also so-and-so. It's a completely weird system (for today's day and time) because of the shift in human culture towards freedom and surplus of food, there is no way such a system of inheritance of caste (honestly I think caste is a very dumb term and shouldn't even exist in the first place) should be present in today's day and age. (Not that it should have existed back then as well). 

I am not against reservation at all, it has helped the people who are called as 'lower castes' (again, I do not believe in the system so it is weird for me to even explain you or tell you what it is, because I do not want to go into the details of it because it is a hard and terrible thing which shouldn't have existed in the first place) but people have not benefited from it socially, as social discrimination on the basis of caste still exists. The problem indeed is a mental one, because when such a system or should I say 'experiment' was started probably nobody had any sort of caste identity. The only divide would have been between the rich and the poor, or the weak and the strong.

&#x200B;

I know that eradication of 'caste' is a long process, but it is all in the mind. After studying evolution of mankind and life, most scientists theorize that humans came from apes and apes came from other such species and so on. It all started from somwhere (Mankind and Life) so everything is connected somehow. (These are just my philosophies which I haven't totally explored :D )

&#x200B;

When  I said it's the first step, I meant that we as a society and a nation should first start with not believing in the entity of caste. No person has any caste and no such thing exists, then the process of balancing and equality will continue which may take as long as the people will (A second or an year, or a century), and then the last step would be us forgetting that such an institution ever existed.

You cant have a committe formed to decide public policies belonging to one priviliged group (which is what we have). Genral people cant get into them unless they are rich. But SC will not be considered even when they are rich. Thats what representation programmes trues to allivate. 

Just like people demanding for women represenatation does. Ofcourse most of those reserved positions for women, when they exist, will mostly go to  rich uppercaste women but that doesnt negate the demand for representation. Poverty is attacked from other programmes, reservations need not be one for it.

Why not fight /make policies for better access to the poor SCs to apply for the programmes and equip them to avail their rightful reservations.
 Also, the govt had basically reserved 10% economic based reservation (which dont see much applications, because they are barely any general students that satisfy those poor criteria, and many of the actual poor alread apply under caste based reservations and they can only avail one.)

Again  reservation is representational reservation. Poverty allevation of programmes work in tandem to allivate economic status of poor dalits, just like they try to do for poor non dalits.

_____

Rumour: India is developing because it does not value merit


Fcat: Almost all of the departments are headed and were headed by upper castes.From IIT faculties to central ministries,everything is headed by upper castes


Rumour:We have 50% reservation


Fact:We had 22.5% reservation till 1990s,AND 22.5% reservations till 2008 in educational institutes


Rumour: Caste discrimination is because of reservation


Fact.WE have NRI quota :no discrimination .We have donation quota:No discrimination.We have state quota:no discrimination.People applying through these quota otherwise have the view that caste discrimiantion is because of reservation.


Conclusion: India is a casteist society.

>Secondly, nowhere do I claim that the privileged Dalit gets more reservation.

What did you mean when you said “they get more benefit”? Reservation is ‘the benefit’ Dalits get based on their caste.


>	Thirdly, nowhere do I want reservations to go down. But I ask you a simple question. Who would you offer the benefits of reservations to- The dailt with a BMW or dailt with a cycle?

That’s a logical fallacy but let me entertain you for the sack of your satisfaction. I want both to get the reservation because both of them are subjected to the same mistreatment.

Then I want the fucked up government to help the poor, regardless of their caste, because that’s what an able government should do, that’s what the government in developed countries do and that’s what we pay taxes for.

Haven't spoken to him since. 

The thing I've noticed was the anger at the other guy who's now a good friend was twofold, 

1) for being a dalit and availing reservation( he conveniently forgot that we all have to pass the same 19 subjects and the practicals to become a doctor)

2) for being upper middle class, as if having money was a sin. 

So I respectfully disagree with your statement, even the well off dalits get badmouthed, but with them it's behind their backs. 



Also, these days if you wanna become a doctor, you need money, there's no place for people without it, blame the govt. 

Even if you get admission in a govt college the cost of textbooks, steths and just living will be a huge burden. 

So what I've seen are only rich/upper middle class people becoming doctors. Almost no one lower middle class and poor.

Article 334. Note that there is always a possibility in extension of reservation at the end of article. So, clearly extension was possible but not desirable as it was introduced as a corrective option in case the government failed to uplift in the given time period. And we have been having these extension since 60 years mate. And yes, ik you will say that this is about Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha seats only, but if you have members from certain community they will definitely push for more reservation as it benefits their vote bank and this, reservation in jobs is created under article 15 and 16; which is constitutionally correct but ethically incorrect as ""total reservation"" has reached it saturation limits. Its bloody 50% plus in many states now. General can simply go fuck itself at this point.

Also, most young blood from general do not give a fuck about what caste you are nowadays (including me which may come as surprise to some Skolars here, who will believe I am against lower castes since I am against misuse of reservation). So why should we pay the price of crimes of our ancestors? Is this North Korea?

>Again reservation is representational reservation. Poverty allevation of programmes work in tandem to allivate economic status of poor dalits, just like they try to do for poor non dalits.

Reservation is representational reservation but its foundation has been built in lack of services and unprivileged nature of certain section of our society. If they were privilidged  and economically flourished there was no need for reservation altogether. But they weren't. Having rEprEsEnTAti0N in jobs was supposed to be a way to make them economically flourished and thus, socially represented. Once they were flourished it was to be revoked unless there would have been no mention of the ""extension"" part in the article 334 provided in above link. Also does this not mean that reserved people are getting double the benefits i.e. reservation in jobs and grants/subsidies from poverty alleviation schemes ???

>Actually we currently have a central govt that supposedly doesnt do vote bak politics. They even introduced economic based reservation. It should be easier for them to relase the data if it fits the narrative of ""anti caste based reservation"" as you soooo strongly believe.

It is not regarding the central government but the actions of those parties who said they will uplift lower castes like BSP, RJD, etc. throughout their tenure. Not a fan of BJP as they do an even more dangerous vote bank than caste-based. But I do believe they should release this data so that we can see how much ""upliftment"" has been actually done in territories controlled by these parties who always promoted reservation for upliftment and representation. BTW a member of RJD asked for 90% reservation.

Which ones do you think were/are not experienced enough to give out the decisions?

If you want a systematic support (just say reservation already !) in CJIs and high posts, FINE!

The class divide exists amongst Dalits too and upper economic class Dalits constantly oppress lower economic class Dalits.

There are reservations in every job sector. But there are so many lower caste people only. They can't do two full time jobs at once yet there are reservations for them in both sectors. So naturally many seats are left unfilled, because there are simply not enough people to do all reserved jobs. Its not like there is departmental bifurcation of reservation like 12% only in clerical, 12% in teaching, 5% in civil services, etc. It is a flat percentage in all place which makes it disproportional when you compare the total reserved  jobs to actual number of people available to do those reserved.

>the govt doesn't provide enough jobs for it to be a poverty alleviation program. govt jobs are less than 4% of total jobs. That's why it was never meant for poverty alleviation. PSU's are already being sold off so there are even less jobs.

This is one of the fallacies of current reservation policy and agreeing that it is fine, is a logical way of saying I agree with fucked up life of poor forward class people.

Trust me mate, those fuckers discriminate against anyone who doesn't have money to pay the bribe and push the file ahead; irrespective of caste.
