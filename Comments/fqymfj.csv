I am from assam which have glorious history and heroes.
We were independent of the other parts of India till British took it. We were never under Mughal empire. We have fought and defeated them 17 times. We treat all Indians equally here in north east. But some people always feel superior despite of having no solid knowledge. We provide oil and tea and other resources to the whole India. But you still treat us like shit. Why so racist? You see a foreigner and always try to make an impression on them while torturing your own country brothers. Someday someone will give a reply and then again you will blame us. Grow outside of shit holes. Treat people equally. You are not superior to us nor are we. Give respect and take respect. Otherwise we will have to do the same thing to all those non north east Indians living here. Live and let us live. Pleaseüôè



Adding go my comment 
 All the people commenting on hatred about each other caste , state , religion I wanna ask you people what we should do? From your viewpoint I guess first we have to fight state wise. Then the winner state will get divided into religion and fight again. Then the winner team gets divided based on caste and fight again. Then I think all problems will be solved. I believe our elder generation had made some mistakes but do we have to follow them blindly? It's 2020 . Get out your mind from colour, religion , caste and try to see a person as a human being. 
We are the educated generation we should at least try to make a change and educate our elders. But no we like to argue, fight over baseless useless things. Busy sipping gao mut. Please I request again please see everybody as human do not judge by caste state religion.

# FAQ
 
## What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
 
## Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
 
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",-1,1,1585478379.0,proawayyy,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

# FAQ
 
## What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
 
## Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
