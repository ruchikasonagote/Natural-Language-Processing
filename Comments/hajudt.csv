This man is questioning 2 university professors on the actions of their Goverment / Army. How the fuck are they supposed to know anything?

He used harsh words against folks who had no part to play in this.  The professors were well spoken and kind and well spoken throughout.

&#x200B;

He kept calling China 'delusional', which is ironic.

&#x200B;

He kept saying India is 'united', which is also ironic since he has played a key part on dividing this country

He kept flexing about the number of people watching his show, which added no value.

fv453ao,"First of all let me start out by greeting my fellow earthly neighbors in India a group of people that are renowned throughout the world for their history, culture, hospitality, intellect/ingenuity and humanity.

I am Muslim from Kuwait and I wanted to convey my deepest sympathy and regret regarding these barbaric atrocious acts by the Chinese military during yesterdays border skirmish.

Though I might have my own issue with the Prime Minister Modi, the BJP and certain issues regarding the treatment of Muslims in India I will not mix them since they are two seperate issues. The Muslims residing in India are much better off than their Chinese counterparts across the border and light years ahead in terms of religious, economic and social freedoms.

I have seen videos of these border skirmishes before and from my humble knowledge these engagements usually tantamount to a drunken brawl after a night out to the pub or fisticuffs between two groups on the road something which is common everywhere on earth. A little pushing and shoving is what I expected from these encounters between the two sides not a one sided massacre from an increasingly aggressive Chinese side who seem to not respect any group of people other than their own.

fv3mt1o,"I don't think we understand the dire situation we are in, with respect to the negotiations with China. According to a study, the Chinese phone companies (Vivo, Mi, Redmi, Oppo etc.,) own 66% of the market share among our country's mobile phone users. Not sure what other areas they have penetrated into. I think this is why people around the world are afraid to say anything against China. China has huge investments in a lot of countries and can effectively control them. I am not sure how many of our friends are actually friends and will come to our aid in need. 

Similarly, the economic impact on many countries if China stops their exports is enormous and those countries can't risk it. So, in principle, they can put pressure on those countries to keep out. Also, God knows what kind of investments China has in India and what happens to our already falling economy if they withdrew or threaten those countries who wants to invest in India. 

Hopefully, we will be able to protect our territorial integrity. But unfortunately, we are being bullied at this moment.

1. It’s a famine, it’s their issue. Doesn’t explain why the world should hate them for it. 

2. You care about landlords? 

3. “Massacre” lol, we have no proof that it was a massacre. There are many sources from the incident that tell that the protestors weren’t killed. 

4. Falun Gong is literally a Scientology-like cult, if you believe them then no wonder.

5. “Cultural Genocide” again another headline term that doesn’t mean anything, Tibet improved economically vastly under China. 

6. Sources required, this Uyghur thing is highly exaggerated on reddit especially. If you see any news article regarding it. The Source will mostly be Radio Free Asia which is literally a CIA propaganda outlet. And one of the CIA agents even got found out in an AMA on reddit regarding this. Her name is Rushan Abbas, check it out. 

Also they are re-education camps, few years back there were many terror attacks by Uyghurs. This was a step to reintegrate them into society. If something like that happened in USA, they would be shot down straight away. 

7. Lol what crushing of freedom? The HK “freedom” movement is a joke. It’s only a vocal minority that are supporting the movement, most of the HKongers support China or don’t care. And the movement started when China wanted to extradite a rapist. So, they literally started a movement to protect a rapist. Not to mention, the foreign influx, a lot of American media is particularly interested in HK than let’s say Bolivia, Venezuela, Yemen or countries where US govt is massacring people. HK literally has corporations for politicians. 

Also something to note, so far 0 HK rioters have been killed (in fact the rioters burned a man alive for being “pro-China”) despite the protests been going for more than year yet more people died one week in America for protesting George Floyd’s death.

It was because of a lack of a pandemic why manufacturing never picked up in India in the past 7 decades.    /s

>but the major problem to take on would be the lack of raw material rather than the production cost 

Are you 2nd/3rd generation NRI who has never visited India? Raw material exports take a huge percentage of trade for India. Being the 7th largest country in the world, we have a massive land massive and an incredible amount of raw material.

Setting up manufacturing will take massive legal reforms in land, taxes, MSME's support, and training, ease of doing business, credit availability, banking, labor laws, basic infrastructure, education etc etc etc.

Politicians in a democracy have zero incentives to invest Govt time, effort, and capital in manufacturing because by the time the results are there to see, there is someone else in power ready to take credit for it. Private players who do are seen as a source of party funds and bribes.

It took China 3-4 decades of concentrated effort to create the massive manufacturing supply chain with which they dominated global trade.

Japan is giving packages for this purpose. India is making campaigns like Atmnirbhar(self reliance) and starting to make economic, land, and labour reforms to promote local and attract foreign businesses. Some US businesses are going to Vietnam, Thailand due to trade war and Covid.

fv4poxv,"If you think about it, every idiot on this planet earth dismisses ""Don't believe China's numbers"". Most political data around the world is always corrupt, always massaged. 

The key is to normalize this official data, add your own weights and make informed decisions -- like investing in Alibaba or Tencent in it's early stages when every idiot on planet earth was saying ""Don't believe Chinese companies numbers"".

There is nuance in data and you have to dig deeper, correlate with other indicators and numbers and get the **first order and direction right**.

And China mostly has this in control. The universe doesn't reward repeating popular opinions, but doing your own due diligence.

fv57cl7,Dude think about it. China is the best country in the world to control this situation. They were shoving people inside and welding their doors shut. They’ll execute anyone who disobeys a command. If anything China should be the best at controlling the spread of the disease.

Chinese Government had initial hypothesis about a lot of things and as data came through they corrected them and communicated them. 

Remember they were the first country to hit with the virus. Unlike other countries which had plenty of warnings and data, they were flying blind.

Oh and speaking of getting brainwashed by propoganda, guess which countries believe in the following propoganda?

i) 5G causes coronavirus (hint: not China)

ii) It was designed to vaccinate and implant chips (hint: not China)

iii) Designed to destroy World Economy or force people to wear masks (hint: not China)

iv) Only as deadly as a flu (hint: not China)

Start thinking for yourself and tell me how these will affect a country's response / management to a pandemic.

Which countries do you think will respond better the next pandemic? How about their citizens? Think of US and UK about their approach to Social Distancing, Wearing Masks, Vaccination the next pandemic hits.
