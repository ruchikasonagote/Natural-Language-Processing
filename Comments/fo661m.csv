Updating as he's speaking

1. Consider this as a curfew - Modi
2. This will be a 3-week lockdown...
3. As per experts -If we are not able to control it in 3 weeks, we will have to pay a huge price for this.
4. 1 infected guy can infect hundreds in less than a week as per the experts and initially, you won't be able to detect any symptoms.
5. Italy and America have world-class facilities still they were not able to stop it from spreading.
6. From their experience we can learn that there is only one way to cope with this Virus, We have to stay at home ""no matter what happens"", Practice Social Distancing.
7. Don't cross that Laxman-Rekha, break the chain.
8. Our current actions will decide the fate of our country.
9. ""Jaan hai toh Jahan hai""
10. If we won't behave in these 21 days of lockdown, it could result into a setback of 21 years.
11. Pray and appreciate the efforts of those Ambulance drivers, nurses, doctors who are working for us and sanitizing our localities.
12. Appreciate the efforts of the security forces who are away from their families and they have to deal with our rude behavior sometimes.
13. WHO, Medical experts are guiding us and the Central Government is taking appropriate steps to cope with this issue.
14. INR 15,000 Crore allocated to improve our medical infrastructure.
15. Medical and Paramedical training will be provided.
16. Healthcare will be the first priority of every state from now on.
17. Please don't pay attention to fake news.
18. PLEASE Don't take any medicines before you consult any doctor at any cost, it could be fatal.
19. Take care of your family, The only way we can get through this is by maintaining this lockdown
20. Please follow all the rules and guidelines given out by WHO and Central Government.

\--End of Speech-- (Now correcting if I put anything wrong here, although I'm sure I didn't miss anything)

Tl:DR

1. Social distancing is the only way to fight this.
2. 21 days will decide our fate.
3. Whole country under Lockdown (consider it a curfew only) until 14th April (21 days)
4. ALL ESSENTIAL SERVICES WILL REMAIN FUNCTIONAL.",670,0,1585060833.0,,1585069360.0,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

fldbob6,"My father is undergoing second chemotherapy tomorrow, not sure what is happening.

Guys I am scared.

Edit: the main issue is no shops were open in Chandigarh, Mohali area where the medicine required for the chemo is being sold. They are not even answering the phones. We were hoping on tomorrow but now I am wondering if those medical stores will be open.

[These](https://i.imgur.com/WaWnKtE.jpg) are the two [medicines](https://i.imgur.com/1uvYI2K.jpg).


Edit 2: Had a call with one of the dealers, he says the shop (selling the required medicines, situated in Sector 11 Chandigarh) will be open by 0900 tomorrow. God bless this country especially the poor.

Edit 3: [UPDATE : March 25]

ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ

Yeah boys, we got the medicine today, though one of the salt iv solution were not available (from one brand).

Yesterday, one of the redditor in the oncology field advised to use the same medicine from a different brand.

Our doctor confirmed this too.

So we bought that medicine drug and everything went smooth from there on.

My mother and I are so relieved, thank you for so many replies, suggestions and support. You guys rock

Probably should mention the situation in Chandigarh, we did notice that people are rushing towards medical stores like every other general essential services and there were long queues of people there.

I just hoped he would have been clear about the essential supplies as people are swarming to stores right now. They are scared, and I empathize with them because people get afraid. PM should have emphasized that people should not go out now. Now, because of the crowding, there will so many more people who will get infected. I expect cases to rise even more now, because of this.

Another thing that should be done ASAP is **educating the goddamn cops with what are essential goods and not to just laathi charge people going to buy vegetables or medicines.** Sure, beat the shit of people loitering or taking selfies of empty roads but for fucks sake, stop harassing people who are out buying essentials. An acquaintance of mine was not only hit by cops but was given a lecture as to why he didn't stock up on vegetables earlier. Do these dense idiots not realize vegetables don't last very long?

Are there any NGOs we can donate to that can help such people with food and essentials during these times.

flgww8t," Yesterday, I commented on this thread that I am having to go to the hospital during this lockdown on weekdays. My friend (from Nodia, WB) is presently living with us (Kolkata, WB) for her Stage 3 cancer treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital, New Town, Kolkata. Her radiation will be going on for 28 days, Monday to Friday.

We have hired a car. We carry papers and ID (including patient ID) and even have a signboard on the car saying that it's going to the hospital. Today, while we were inside the hospital, our driver was beaten up by the cops at the parking lot, just in the same way you guys are seeing in the videos that are being shared online. He stated the reason why he was there. The cops did not contact us or anything, he was simply beaten up.

This is anarchy.

I am not on social media other than Reddit and I do not intend to be because of how unreasonable people are in general. However, I would like to inform you all that certain cops are beating up people, whether they have a reason to or not. They are not communicating at all. We are trying our best to find out which police personnel exactly did this and take the relevant legal steps after the lockdown is lifted. I do not think that the police have orders to beat up anyone they wish to.

I would also like you all to warn others. And if you or any person you know is presently deployed to police the roads during the lockdown, kindly let us know what rules/instructions you have.

honestly, it isn't. Indians love taking orders from above and absolving themselves of individual responsibility. Use that. Do what Canada is doing.

If people don't listen as is very likely, use an increasingly strict curfew till only essential services are running. 14 days of changes, tops, from beginning to full curfew.
