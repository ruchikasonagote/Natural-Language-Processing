*But since* Bhang is often associated with Holi celebrations (so much so that it keeps coming up in actual Holi songs!), it's hard to ignore it as a festival-specific drink. It's like drinking eggnog on Christmas. Not everybody cares for it, but it's still very much a Christmas-y thing.

Holi (minus all the religious nonsense) can be really fun if you've got a great group of friends and a loving community (and have a thing for violence ;D).

Haven't played in a long while but I've mostly fond childhood memories around this holiday.

jbjkv7n,"Was always fun to skate there (years ago now). Would go with a large group of friends when I was fifteen or so. 

The brick pathways made the wheels sound like a bike tire with a card in it. My feet felt like it too. 

With all of us riding to a different spot together it created a, what is for me now, cacophony of nostalgia.  

I will never hear it again.",4,5,1678373310.0,AyybrahamLmaocoln,False,positive,positive,positive,positive
