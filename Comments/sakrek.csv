htujvrv,"This hurts to read, man. Every single time I see news about another student committing suicide, it brings back memories of a friend I lost. He was a few years senior to me and from my hostel. So, he wasn't just a friend but also a mentor and a wingman.

I remember him being stressed out cause of his final project, telling him the profs would be idiots to fail him and going to sleep at 6 am, only to wake up at 1 pm to find out he committed suicide. 

That dude just wanted to get out of the rat race. He used to tell me once he had enough saved up, it didnt matter if he was in his thirties or forties, he would quit it all. He made it to 23. I lost a friend, an amazing engineer and a LAN god (as if that ever mattered), because his professor didnt think his project was good enough. 

To any of you guys on here, who are feeling down. Please seek help. Things might appear bad right now, but you never know how it turns out. 

Here's the kick in the guts. I helped him build a cooling system for his PC so that he could host a hub and mine bitcoins. He was insanely into bitcoins and used to run his system all night IN 2010. If he was alive, he could have retired by now finally beating the ""rat race"".",1175,0,1642917716.0,mystery1411,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

I love History and Geography and Wanted to Pursue Arts, but only 2 streams exist according to my parents, you probably know which 2! And you know what's worse, Now my father says that ""go ahead leave Medical and Pursue arts!"", But I can't, after spending an entire year in 11th Medical, coz then the year will go waste. And I myself, have considered committing suicide multiple times since started 11th Grade. But I know, I would not be able to clear NEET the first time. And on top of that, I have a cousin sister, who is just a year younger than me, has less facilities, yet is a topper in Aakash( Institute where I and my Sister are Enrolled) and Oh, If it isn't clear by now she's also in 11th medical. This gives my parents, an easy comparison for me and to scold me for not getting good marks. This is because She has interest in being a Doctor, whereas I thought being a doctor was the Worst.

htulgdl,"Can totally relate to what he was going through. In the last 11 months we were made to write 3 semester exams... A semester is supposed to be 6 months long. Not only that but we've had to give up our winter break, weekends and holidays in the name of corporate training. Nobody in the higher ups wants to accept that we're in a pandemic. Everybody pretends that nothing is wrong but these last few years have been the most uncertain ,most stressful years of many young adults' entire lives. The income inequality has only become worse during the pandemic, people are barely making ends meet if you put professional pressures and academic challenges on top of these issues,you only create chaos. People should be given breathing room to grow and rejuvenate. Nobody can deny that they have had a rough couple of years just now and would like to be burdened with these things slowly. In the end I would just like to say that if you're someone who feels like they've been exhausted and feel defeated or worthless lately just know that you're not. If anything you've become stronger by going through what you've just gone through. Keep your head up and believe in the future, however bleak it may seem there is always a better time ahead. Pretending that everything is fine is not a sustainable model and it would take nothing short of a revolution to bring some solid changes in the society but we're not ready to talk about that just yet.

""Suicide never ends the pain, it passes to someone else""
-An old lady from an YouTube video

I am sorry for this person. May he/she rest in peace

This generation is more depressed than ever...

I never thought about suicide but I feel down. What keeps me going up is just this character from Berserk 'Guts'. Whenever I feel bad, I always say ""He is still struggling after enduring the worst of the worst. He is still standing to protect the most irreplaceable thing he love, he failed, he succeded, he still suffer, but my problems aren't even that big. If he can stand up on his two feets, can struggle each and every day for years, can fight his own inner demons, his fear, himself then why can't I"" and that keeps me going. 
Never knew the most dark and gruesome story can be so hopeful.

When i was in college back in 2013 i was struggling with depression, had suicidal thoughts stopped going to college somehow managed courage to speak to my mom and dad about this and they said 'ab ye kya naya natak hai?  We are ashamed of you...jab 4 log khade hote hai toh unke samne darr lagta hai k koi ye na puch le k aapke bache kya kr rhe hai' etc etc i can never forget those lines, i didn't know how to get help, i was desperate and i remember i discovered 7cups.com during that time, luckily met a retired therapist from US who was working for free and spoke to her for a month.

htwse1l,"I felt this way back when I was doing engineering. Being from a minority religion but studying in a brahmin college made things worse as curd-licking over-entitled so-called teachers would be racially offensive and make my life hell just for kicks whereas brainless idiots who happened to be brahmin would be treated like royalty.

At one point I felt so angry and frustrated that I wanted to die by suicide. I was washing my face so I put my ID card to the back of my neck and after my wash, I forgot to pull it back and was walking back to class. A professor caught me and asked me where is it. I realized it was behind and pulled it in front. He saw my name and took my ID and asked me to run to class and meet him during the next break to get it back. I tried to explain it but in vain. I remember that day so well till today—I went to the mechanical workshop where this fool was. He asked me to apologise to another professor at the workshop who was sitting in the other room and get it from him—who in turn said he won’t give the ID unless the other professor accepted an apology and said I can get it. It was a loop and I was frustrated. I was stressed out and the idea to just roll into the latte machine and squash myself to death than deal with these fuckers who were playing around with me popped into my head.

But then I realized how shitty life had become, having lost a parent just before my state exams, flunked my exams due to the ensuing anguish, ending up in a dreadful college where these teachers and staff were rude and mean, many of the classmates were too, and where I didn’t fit in and that I was considering killing myself than to deal with these people. I realised that if I’ve measured my life and it’s struggles and decided to throw it just over something that would be this trivial, then is that how much I value my life? I thought about the student who jumped and died a couple of months ago and the college tried to bury that story and gave everyone half the day off which made me realise that is the value of this person’s life according to them.

I decided at that moment to live my life with no bounds or fears, not to be bowing down to racist authorities ever again. So I told the professors that I can’t play this game as neither of them are making up their mind and that they should both discuss together and come to an agreement and let me know and I just headed to class leaving them be. This angered them more and the professor caught me at the end of the day and asked me how I can talk that way. I told him he wasn’t being reasonable or logical so I didn’t know what else I could do. He then asked me to write an apology letter and get it signed by my father and he’ll return the ID. I said okay and had a really long 2-page letter with some rarely used words written and signed by my father (at-least he understood my struggle and didn’t think twice to sign) and I gave it to the professor. He read it, laughed, asked me to explain the words and then finally returned my ID card.

I couldn’t finish my engineering. Ended up with a lot of backlogs despite being good with my subjects. Am the best in my work and yet that was the case there. Somehow that brahmin dude who sits in front and can’t think for shit was able to clear a dozen papers in one go. I started a business instead of joining somewhere because I figured better be my own boss. It was a struggle but I clawed my way thro’. That fucker still teaches there in the same position tormenting other souls whereas my venture became successful and I have made a rather comfortable living. Things would have gone a lot differently if I had made a different decision back then.

So to anyone who ever comes to a point of reflection like this person did and decided to put an end to their life—please realize that when you are at this point where you have nothing to lose, you have only to gain. It’s the beginning of your freedom. Freedom from all these artificial shackles the world has made. You don’t answer to anybody. Live life the way you want it, on your own terms. Choose what you want as your religion—it’s all made up anyway. Struggle, lose sleep, toil and achieve whatever you want without giving two fucks to anyone who tells you that you can’t esp. not the char log or sharmaji who lives next door. This is your life and it’s a better usage of life to struggle, suffer and achieve something despite all the hardships than just laying it down!",2,0,1642962729.0,timetraveller1992,1642963151.0,negative,negative,negative,negative

Its not the professor's fault. He was implementing his course metrics as he saw fit. Unless there's an allegation that he was biased or something, that was his job and he was doing it sincerely. The ""fault"", if any, lies in a system that puts too much importance on these metrics and does not include a way to bring out other talent.

As someone who was forced to participate in the rat race as a kid and has now completely removed myself from it, let me tell you that the rat race is the fucking problem and no it hasn't always existed and it won't last very long either ( when automation makes most skilled, semi-skilled , unskilled jobs obselete there won't be any rat race). The world is changing and after the pandemic it's crystal clear that it has, forever. We were raised to survive the world that our parents grew up in and look around yourself that world doesn't exist anymore, we have internet and with it comes business opportunities that were unimaginable in the past, there's very little barrier on knowledge and education, there's social media and I believe it's done more bad than good to the society but opens up avenues of earning even for a stay at home 40 year old mother of two. So why would you say that millions of people fighting for a few hundred openings is not the problem, why not thinking for oneself or creatively is not the problem? At the end of the day success is having your necessities met and spending a happy life isn't it?

I took up competitive programming and initially struggled a lot in it because wasn't very comfortable with the kind of stuff discrete math competition problems had. But that was the best of my options at the time (in college), so I stuck with it and in 1-2 years I got really good at it and also found a lot of parts of it that really interest me (especially now that I had become good). I still didn't like certain parts of it, but kind of liked it enough to do/discuss it in my free time...

It always existed in the context of transactions. It’s just human nature to compete. We , with our population , surplus grads and general mentality has created this version of rat race. But this is not unique to us, China and Japan has had this way before us.

I sympathize with the victim and all the other cases but the reality is that this rat race has been source of financial upgrade for many more people. Not every engineer has to be an engineer , most of the times a degree is enough to get an entry level job. 

You can apply the driving example to literally any mode of transport. Movement, accidents, preventive measures. 

I’ve read a lot of comments about not participating in the rat race, or gaining knowledge and starting your business. 

Unfortunately, the customers are the rats like me. I wouldn’t be able to buy your stuff if I wasn’t working.

I may sound defeatist, or something but just look at the bigger picture, why are we so interested in edge cases?  On one side of the spectrum we have victims, on the other side we have people who have done great for themselves. I would base by opinions on people in the middle.

I am no position to suggest solution as I am a rat myself. Most of us are either rats or liers.

But here are few things that I’d want my kids to grow up with
1 . Showing off material Wealth is a no go.
2. Me being exposed to multiple trades and then knowing that’s there are other things in life , apart from an engineer or a doctor.

People should be given a chance to follow their passion. That doesn't mean not have an alternate back up plan. Do get a degree in a field with relatively good career options as a back up plan. Nothing wrong there. But the focus on getting into medicine/engineering is disproportionate - both to the needs of the society as well as opportunities. That means people who get into a low tier engineering college for that degree often end up taking non engineering jobs. Ultimately they don't get use of their degree. It might be better for them to actually pursue a field of their interest instead.

ETA: Parents shouldn't have to tell kids the career path with safety net. At 18, you should instead be given enough awareness to know the consequences of your choice - what the likely outcomes are for your career  choices. Reasoning is different from emotional blackmail/coercion. Let kids make an informed decision. In fact, allowing the kid to realize what he/she needs to do will actually motivate them to pursue their choice instead of feeling forced to follow some path that was chosen for them. 

Bottom line again for this post wasn't safety net - its about mental health and causes for young adults to commit suicide. That stems from undue expectations kept on these kids.

As an anti-capitalist, I'd certainly want more radical change in the future, but for now I think we should try and get some welfare and social safety nets in place like minimum wage and affordable housing so you're not forced to go with one of those mainstream career paths. 

>But the focus on getting into medicine/engineering is disproportionate - both to the needs of the society as well as opportunities.

The vast majority of the population isn't progressive and they're also poor. And it really is a struggle to ponder about higher values when you're trying not to starve. I suppose that's why people, mostly the poorer ones, find it reasonable to agree with their parents (who were also brought up in similar circumstances) and go with those historically high paying jobs. 

I think this goes with most conservative ideals. Shit like this is passed over through generations and because each and every one of them is poor, they don't have the time, the energy, or the resources to think about why those lines of thought are wrong. This is probably why underdeveloped/developing countries tend to be more reactionary when you'd expect the opposite considering the day and age.

EDIT:

>At 18, you should instead be given enough awareness to know the consequences of your choice - what the likely outcomes are for your career choices. Reasoning is different from emotional blackmail/coercion. Let kids make an informed decision.

I have explained that already, but I'll say it again: Most of these people aren't rich or well-educated in any way, shape or form. Most of them don't even know that there are viable alternatives to the historically high paying jobs. It's a rough world. 

>Bottom line again for this post wasn't safety net - its about mental health and causes for young adults to commit suicide.

Well you can blame the parents for this if you want, but the issue just narrows down to capitalism.
