hjk4val,"Hi! Thanks for doing this!

Discussing inauthentic behavior is hard - on the one hand exposing too much plays into the hands of predators who then simply evolve.

On the other, civil society, researchers are divorced from data, statistics and measures of efficacy and harm. Not to mention the incentives for Social Media firms to maintain this state of affairs - making matters even more complex and intractable.

So:

1) Given these contradicting imperatives, how can we thread the needle? What can be discussed, and how do you personally estimate where the lines in the sand can be drawn for disclosure.

2) According to you, who do you think holds the advantage right now in the inauthentic behavior cat/mouse game? The defenders or the attackers? 

( How do we even discuss this, if we have to worry about tipping the balance ?)

hjkp8wt,"Sophie, as an Indian, thank you for your courage. 

My question is : Does Facebook have a scalable solution that can at least partially solve deceptive behavior online (networks/misinformation), but they refuse to use it (either because it reduces profits) ? 

Or do they have no idea how to tackle this problem because it is too hard to distinguish between deceptive content (fake networks / misinformation) and reasonable content (genuine networks / valid information).

Are they afraid that they might anger the wrong people by censoring their posts even though they know the behavior is deceptive, OR, is it that on a technological level, the moderators/AI cannot keep up with the rate at which deceptive content is created.

For instance, earlier this year, in April, India was ravaged by Covid. On social media websites, you would see tons of posts like ""A Covid ICU bed is available at XYZ hospital.

2. Were there others in the team who shared similar ideologies? If so, did they get fired too?

3. What sort of moderation did FB had, if any, to counter fake accounts and hate speeches? How strict/proactive were the people in combating the same? 

4. Are you aware of any instances when FB turned a blind eye to the above issues due to political pressure in a DEMOCRACY? I can understand if it’s related to revenue, or it happening in autocracies, but my question is strictly in terms of democratic political vendetta (eg. an entire nation’s government forcing FB to act in certain ways)",2,0,1636211889.0,crippledcoder,1636236702.0,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral

I know you do not have the expertise in this, but how do you *perceive* the functioning of Reddit as compared to Facebook?

In the context of India, although there are not that many Indian targets for manipulation here, there certainly seems to be some manipulation going on on the worldwide audience. Reddit has policies against subreddit brigading and vote manipulation and other inauthentic behavior, yet a significant amount of posts on /r/worldnews and other international subreddits that show problems in India, or are critical of certain politics or political parties, are suppressed by unusual percentage of downvotes, in a very short time too. It has all the smells of an organized group being behind it. Yet Reddit does not seem to be taking any action. Or, at least we don't see any change.

Some of the Indian right-wing/far-right subreddits here have circulated much more nastier stuff than anything in American far-right subreddits. There is significant amount of hate and dehumanization in such subreddits. Once again, Reddit's ""Anti-Evil Operations"" seems to be looking the other way. In general, they seem to not want to be proactive and only react with ""bold steps"" after a significant media coverage occurs (this is a common perception seen across reddit). And it looks like Reddit is suffering from similar problems and issues as Facebook - language barrier, lack of cultural context, finding the right balance, enforcing differential regional policies, risk of going against majoritarian beliefs, the lure of a big market, etc.

In terms of size, the smallest was \~50-60 accounts - the network connected to the BJP MP.

I'll use an analogy. Suppose an average Indian decides to go out and look for PRC spies. They will not find any actual PRC spies - which is not to say that they don't exist in India. Rather, anyone that they find will be normal Indians who behave a bit oddly. Or Indians who celebrate Halloween and have dressed up as a PRC spy for the holiday. Or perhaps they'd suspect Chinese Indians who are actually loyal to India. But any PRC spies that they find would be utterly incompetent. And so this is why the Indian government does not (and cannot) rely on regular people to find PRC spies for them and instead needs highly trained and secretive IB operatives with to do so.

Internal leadership at Facebook is very clear and confident in their formal stance that they do not play political favorites, including in India. I think that saying anything else would be a good way to get half their Indian employees to quit on the spot.

&#x200B;

I don't know if this is especially unusual as companies go - I'm sure that Dow Chemical internally proclaims that Bhopal wasn't their fault when asked by employees. With that said, FB is fairly open as far as companies go in terms of letting employees discuss. 

&#x200B;

For instance, when the [WSJ articles on Ankhi Das's support for the BJP came out](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-executive-supported-indias-modi-disparaged-opposition-in-internal-messages-11598809348), the official FB leadership response was that her comments were taken out of context. As a result, I decided that I would very helpfully provide the context that leadership said we were missing by assembling and organizing her other internal statements from the time period for the benefit of other employees. Alas, the additional context did not make her comments look any better, and FB chose for some reason to delete all of them by the next morning.

hjkbxgt,"Thanks for these thoughtful questions  


1) It's absolutely true that disclosures carry certain risks. This is the reason why I don't provide any details about how I caught adversaries - attackers are perfectly capable of reading Reddit as well.

&#x200B;

I feel comfortable disclosing my work in India for several reasons:

a) Facebook already acted to take down most of the networks. As a result, the attackers know very well that they were caught (except the BJP MP.)

b) It is no secret that IT cells occur in India. Reporting on the work I conducted will likely not create any incentive for people to make more IT cells.

c) Because of the decision of FB not to act following discovery of the direct involvement of a MP, I believe it is societally important to India to disclose these details.

But there are also countries in which the considerations are different and so I have disclosed less detail as a result. 

&#x200B;

There are also additional considerations when it comes to disclosures from companies .Currently FB has made the commitment to disclose its takedowns for coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB.) This has had the side effect that CIB investigations are very difficult, time-consuming, and politically sensitive (and hence potentially open to interference) because the company feels it is necessary to announce who is responsible and not be wrong. As a result, all of the work I did in India was not disclosed by FB, as it was taken down for inauthentic behavior rather than CIB - just as its easier for the Indian police to convict someone of ""culpable homicide not amounting to murder"" than for murder.

&#x200B;

2) It's very hard to say. I'd say that it's a fairly neutral balance, where attackers previously held the advantage.

&#x200B;

3) You can look up trainings on disinformation/cybersecurity/etc. But frankly I don't have a good idea because I never had any training in this myself (figured it all out in my spare time.)

September or October 2019: I first discovered three networks of fake accounts (two pro-INC, one pro-BJP) in India. There were eventually five (two pro-INC, two pro-BJP, one pro-AAP), but two discoveries came later.

November 2019: I raised these networks to an investigator. Nothing came of it.

December 2, 2019: Because of the silence, I raised them to the investigator again. He agrees to find the right person if I write it up as a task, which I do.

December 3, 2019: A different investigator confirms my findings

December 10, 2019: I discover an additional pro-BJP network (which was eventually discovered to be linked to the benefiting MP.)

December 11, 2019: The investigator verifies my findings for the additional network

December 14, 2019: I remind people that we are still waiting for a response

December 19, 2019: A decision is reached to take down all four networks of fake accounts. The first three networks of fake accounts are taken down. The fourth (found on December 10) is forgotten, which I point out.

December 20, 2019: The fourth network of fake accounts is found to be tied to a BJP MP. I conduct additional investigation to verify my findings and make sure that no mistakes were made, and ask for the fake accounts to be taken down (while the MP is left alone), or an official decision on the matter.

December 23, 2019: I note that one of the pro-INC networks (in Punjab) has returned with new fake accounts, and request for it to be taken down again.

January 6, 2020: The investigator verifies my findings

January 8, 2020: I am officially ordered by Facebook to stop conducting civic work (including in India) as it is not considered important to Facebook. I successfully argue for responsibly finishing existing work, and manage to get away with continuing this case.

January 19, 2020: I discover a pro-AAP network of fake accounts began influencing the Delhi elections on January 16. Very oddly, many of the fake accounts are shared with the pro-INC Punjab network (perhaps the IT cells hired the same accounts?)

January 27, 2020: Due to lack of response from Facebook on the pro-AAP fake accounts in Delhi with the election imminent, I raise the subject directly at an internal civic summit intended to focus on U.S. 2020. This convinces FB to act

January 28, 2020: I discuss the problem in Delhi with an India public policy manager, who agrees that it's important and should be taken down ASAP. I also request to them that a decision be made on the BJP MP network, which is ignored.

January 29, 2020: An employee says that they took down the pro-AAP Delhi and pro-INC Punjab fake accounts. They actually forgot to do so after posting.

February 3, 2020: Delayed response from myself due to being sick. I point out that the takedown did not actually happen. I also request once again a decision on the BJP MP network

February 4, 2020: The investigator takes down the networks herself (second takedown of pro-INC Punjab fake accounts, first takedown of pro-AAP Delhi fake accounts.) However, they immediately return with new fake accounts.

February 6 and 7, 2020: The investigator twice acts to take down new waves of fake accounts that I find. This apparently succeeds in convincing the IT cell that we meant business with the upcoming Delhi elections, and they don't appear to bother returning after the takedown on the 7th.

In contrast, inauthenticity depends solely on the user; if I dispatch 1000 fake accounts onto Reddit to comment ""Cats are adorable"", the words don't matter - it's still inauthentic behavior. If Reddit takes the fake accounts down, they're correct to do so no matter how much I yell ""they're censoring cute cats!""`  
  
  
  
`There are genuine questions regarding how to respond to misinformation and hate speech while protecting freedom of speech. But no one serious defends the right of a politician to set up a network of inauthentic accounts supporting himself. Stopping this is necessary to protect freedom of speech, not a violation of those principles - just as stopping ballot stuffing is necessary to protect the sanctity of the ballot and the right to vote.`

&#x200B;

You're asking specifically about misinformation, which I'm not an expert on, but I can try to answer.

&#x200B;

Facebook usually does not directly take down misinformation. Instead, it relies on third-party fact checkers (akin to e.g. alt news in India) to decide whether content is misinformation, and then provides a label (""this content was fact-checked - see the fact check here"") and downranks it if it were found to be misinformation.

&#x200B;

I say ""usually"" because FB has e.g. made the decision that COVID and anti-vaccine misinformation is not permitted because of the resulting severe risks to life, and has taken down some misinformation networks in first-world countries.

A large part of the problem, as I see it, is that at Facebook the people in charge of public policy (and deciding what the rules are and how they should be enforced) are the same people as those tasked with lobbying governments and politicians. This creates a natural conflict of interest.

  
It's true that Facebook is a company - but so are the Times of India, the New York Times, the Guardian, and Der Spiegel. These news organizations usually keep a stringent separation between their editorial department and lobbying efforts. It would be unthinkable for Der Spiegel to kill an article because it made a German politician look bad; at Facebook this would be business as usual. And this is an organizational dynamic that is not common in technology companies as I understand it - Twitter keeps them separate. And so when I testified to the British parliament 3 weeks ago, I proposed regulation that would require companies over a certain size to keep these departments separate.

&#x200B;

But this would not solve all the problems. Twitter has also given in to political pressure from governments such as Russia and (unfortunately) India to make decisions that were arguably politically motivated.

In Brazil, for instance, vote buying is sadly widespread and somewhat normalized, when it has been a major scandal in Japan and would be unthinkable in Britain.

People who carried candles for nirbhaya haven't cared for rapes done before or after. It was just another example of the extremely hypocritical behaviour of the Indian middle class.  Anna Hazare movement was something that was needed, it's probably something that is even more important today. But, the government has a death grip on the media, so anything said out is line will be quelled. Also the social media campaigns of the government have been far more superior to the others'. So, Anna Hazare wouldn't be able to catch the public attention and the movement would die out.

hjqumkl,">In the 2g spectrum allocation scam, the exchequer was royally fucked and the cag didn't need to manufacture numbers.

You're still falling for the propaganda. Allocation at fixed price instead of auction was a policy decision. And in light of the mess the mobile telecom industry is right now, th right decision. Government is not a for profit corporation listed on a stock market that it needs to show profits in quarterly report at all costs to ensure stock prices and CXO bonus. In fact, during UPA itself, after auctions were forced by the combination of CAG and SC overstepping their mandates, there was a real scam - Jio acquiring 4G spectrum with subterfuge and then gaining undue advantage over competitors by getting permission to use it for voice: https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/4g-19000-crore-mystery-cag-figure-undue-benefit-mukesh-ambanis-reliance-jio-shrank (ignore the ""notioinal loss"" bullshit in the article, but there's a real loss estimated by CAG, and real unfair competitive advantage gained by Jio elaborated well in the article). No one talks about that scam, or the later scam duning mudiraj where Jio used RCom spectrum and neither paid the government for it. 

> But what a lot of the supporters of Inc fail to remember is the number is terrorist attacks that happened during the Manmohan Singh government. The threat of global radical islam is at least as real as the threat of a radical Hindu government dictating every aspect of your existence. The truth is this country needs someone who can deal with the former without going overboard in terms of fascism. But a lot of people don't know that. They are convinced that what we have now is the right answer and are giving up their rights freely.

 While you're quick to blame MMS government for global islamic terror attacks, you forget that it was the previous NDA government that released the masterminds of these terror attacks in response to a hijacked plane that was taken to afghanistan due to gross mishandling of the response to hijacking by the government. Count the number of islamic terrorist attacks happening during Mudiraj, and hear the deafening silence. Why is that? Is it because they are currently mainly limited to Kashmir? Will they remain limited to kashmir? What you forget is that fight with terrorism is an evolving competition, and balance keeps shifting back and forth. The truth is that unless the root cause is fixed globally (like US sponsorship of terror sponsorring regimes in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, constant wars for oil and weapons sales in the middle east etc.), the terrorists will continue with their activities, and they will sometimes succeed, as the balance keeps oscillating between terrorism and response to it.

The threat of global radical islam is real, and it needs to be countered, but it is not as big or as damaging to the social fabric of this country as the threat posed by hindutva electoral autocracy.

hkg2qxl,"This is a purely subjective opinion, but, terror attacks in India are a consequence of appeasement politics, just like mob lynchings. I dont blame MMS government for the presence of global Islamic terror threat. I am saying that a threat to the whole world exists because of the radical version of Islam taught in various parts of the world. MMS government clearly couldnt deal with its effects in India and the current government clearly can. As, during the MMS government, there were 1-2 bomb blasts in major cities of the country every year and right now there are none(Please inform me if there are any).   


Terrorism in Kashmir is an issue that has always existed. My personal opinion is that it is due to the economic isolation of that state and that will, hopefully, change in the next 20 years because of the recent changes. 

&#x200B;

The current autocracy, in my opinion is just radical religion in a different color. I dont see any difference between Savarkar's hindutva and radical islam, though, being backed by the government makes hindutva a more urgent threat in our country.  They both try to promote a pre historic caveman mindset where women are treated as property and anyone not belonging to their group is considered a threat.

&#x200B;

 India needs to throw away the laws that treat different religions differently and try to assert the constitution and the Indian Penal Code as the most holy books in the country. Anything else is allowed, because the constitution says so. Religious freedom needs to be a privilege and not a right and the privilege needs to be practised while maintaining the tolerance towards the religious freedom of the other. Else, it needs to be taken away.   
Any one in disobedience of these should be punished, irrespective of who the person is. So, in short, corruption should disappear from the system. Which is not what the majority in the country want, so it will never happen and the country will be in a constant state of tug of war between two radical groups, or more.

Same for group chats, add a secret participant in the conversation that is hidden by the client, and the users never find out.

Of course, you can find out if this is happening by disassembling the WhatsApp code and examining what it does. Although that would only be be applicable to that particular APK and version.
