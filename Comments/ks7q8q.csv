A specific example is that big businesses often have the money to pay accountants to makes sure they don't have a profit and therefore don't pay taxes. Meanwhile the small hotel owned by a family doesn't have that same advantage so they pay taxes.

Correct and today Phil Murphy, Joe Biden, Obama (I know, it's a stretch) are all Irish American Democrats. The main sticking point is a) dislike of change/progression b) a very homophobic right wing Catholic Church c) abortion have split Irish Americans.

Correct - if you haven't lived in Ireland for 5-10 years you really have no idea of what it means to be Irish but that's an opinion

Umm - you're conflating generations - Irish and Italians lived (alongside many other European nationals) in Manhattan in tenament buildings and this dates back tot the 1700 and 1800's the Irish and Italians came en masse - which was driven in Ireland by the famine (a famously dark period of Irish history exacerbated largely by our neighbours, the Brits). The Irish and Italians stuck together and formed gangs before and into the 1990's - see: The Irishman, Kil the Irishman, etc etc.

>Up until the 70s people from Poland or Ireland were viewed a lot like how some minorities are today, as 'dirty refugees' bringing in Unions and other foreign elements. Thus the disastrous Raegan-omics we saw in the 80s.

Um, again conflating dates/periods. JFK was an Irish-American Catholic who became president in 1961 and Irish Catholics were the second largest European population in the USA (after Germans) and their position in the US had been solidified since the 1900s.

So Irish and German Catholics (the majority of Irish people being Catholic) were hassled by the Natives (WASPS) and has their churches burned to the ground esp in Manhattan, until an Irish Bishop from Mayo built St Patrick's Cathedral and wrote a letter to the then mayor saying that if it was burned, all of NY would burn (because of the size of the Catholic population). St Patrick's opened in 1878. 

>As for Catholics you need only see the trend in Presidents, they need to be WASPs bro. White, Anglo-saxon Protestant.

Famine/Potato famine is the same thing. So, I'm not aware of any specific anti-Irish sentiment post WWI or WWII because the Irish largely emigrated before. I think you're assuming something - maybe you have something to citate to support this but this might help:

> It is estimated that as many as 4.5 million Irish arrived in America between 1820 and 1930. Between 1820 and 1860, the Irish constituted over one third of all immigrants to **the United States**. In the 1840s, they comprised nearly half of all immigrants to this nation. 

Source: US Gov: [https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/irish/irish-catholic-immigration-to-america/#:\~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20as,all%20immigrants%20to%20this%20nation](https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/irish/irish-catholic-immigration-to-america/#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20as,all%20immigrants%20to%20this%20nation).

In this context, the Irish were too large to be victims of xenophobic discrimination post WWII.

>The 1990s that you're talking about come after the unions and what some of them were openly associated with, the Mob. Boxing being my only sport the two share a rather interesting history in Nevada or Boston or New York.

Yes - the Irish and the Italians topped the list for the most criminals at the turn of the century up to the 1960's. But that's not discrimination.

As in history that is initially passed down through word of mouth and attributes large, slow changes in society to individual persons much like oral myths. Try reading history beyond the school level where there are differing points of view and experience of society within the same society and time period. If you ever have the option to study Sociology, please do.
