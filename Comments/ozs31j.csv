h83fzmx,"For all people saying ""billion people, 2 golds in Olympics"", or ""why no infrastructure"". Yes you are all right to ask this question. But...
Billion people have only countable number of medals because sports in India doesn't fetch you money, except if it is cricket. You need to personally invest time and money into such things. Lack of quality players, means lack of medals at such big stages. With all due credit to our current generation of players, they are not scrutinized and watched properly. I dare selectors to do so in cricket, if the player is not upto the mark, even if he is the son of the most influential person in India, he will will trolled, criticized, and bashed around in media like a ragdoll. This lack of scrutiny is equivalent to a lack of sorry state of affairs for our sportsmen. Unless it's an army trained person, it's probably someone who wins these medals ""despite India"" and not for India. It's hurtful but it's the bitter truth.
That brings me to the second point, the lack of infrastructure, is because no one watches these sports except for the families or the athletes themselves. That means no viewership, which means no sponsorship, which means no infra, which leads to poor performance and then again to no viewership. It's a vicious cycle. I am a part of the problem too. Its too late for me to start caring about each and every individual sport, but we can all start at something. I make it a point to watch kabaddi matches now and actively try to keep up with wrestling. It's the least I can do to ensure I am contributing towards the sport. Cricket is still my favourite, but that doesn't mean we can't spare our interest to other sports too.
So for my fellow Indians, lets at least dignify the sports by actually engaging with them instead of posting WhatsApp stories once a year and then forgetting about it the next day. For everyone else, this is a problem that's been ingrained due to various socio-cultural aspects. Indians are taking cognizance and we are improving. Boxing and wrestling are something more people are actively engaging in. So are in badminton, the day isn't far when we will have the medal tally to justify our population, but until then we still have immense respect for our athletes competing at all levels.

I first became aware of Neeraj maybe a week ago and only as I was looking up old Olympic Records - found Johannes Vetter who was the hot, hot favourite but did not make the top 8.  
  
What is interesting here is the longest ever javelin throw is by East German Uwe Hohn who in 1984 fired one out to 104.80m but he never made the Olympics.  
  
Shortly after this they altered the javelin to what it is now. Moved the centre of gravity forward  by 4cm.   
  
Anyway guess who coaches Neeraj? That's right Uwe - If you are going to have a coach I don't think in Javelin you'll get much better.  
  
So I'm happy both for Neeraj and Uwe in regard to this gold!  
  
I'll also say a week or so ago when I saw on Youtube - Neeraj train and Vetter train - no way you'd be backing Neeraj to win - just shows you what a big stage and the thrill of competition can do to and for an athlete.

Hockey was popular in the 80s, india won cricket World Cup in 1983 when they beat the mighty West Indies who were favourite to win for the third time in a row. That made kids pick up cricket as a sport at junior level, india started beating bigger teams and cricket started becoming more and more popular to the extent that other sports were ignored and became less popular. More sponsorship deals for cricket team means more money which resulted in better facilities to the point that almost every state in India has an international cricket stadium and some states have more than 2. 

And then there are other factors like corruption where money doesn't reach the facilities or grounds are not maintained, players don't get proper diet. 

Same reason why Cricket isn't that popular in US but given the talent and money in other sports like NBA or Football you can easily put out a world class team.

Cricket in india is like soccer in South American countries like Argentina, Brazil. Every kid grows up playing cricket.",3,1,1628355974.0,AnthonyGonsalvez,False,positive,positive,positive,positive

> I think it's a combination of a few factors:

> A) community level professional support and facilities for kids ages 5-15. Every decent suburb town in USA have sports facilities better than national level facilities in India.  Army schools in India do provide this and they do grow up to be better in sports but usually peter out. So essentially it's only enough.

> **B) economic stability : have 1-2 generations where getting a job/ money isn't the isn't key objective of life. For western societies this was the generation post world war. They have social systems with a economic safety net( social security) in their collective memory and can take 5 years out of their young adulthood to focus on other stuff.**
