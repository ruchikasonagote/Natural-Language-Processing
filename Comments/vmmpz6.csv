> On Tuesday, a video emerged on social media showing two men entering a tailor&#039;s shop in Udaipur and proceeding to attack him with knives.

> POTESTS BREAK OUT IN UDAIPUR, INTERNET SUSPENDED. Following the incident, Hindu organisations shut down markets as protests erupted across Udaipur.

ie2ac26,"You know. Every single religion is a rubbish heap cult and filled with hateful cunts, but only in Islam do people think it's okay to behead someone. 

And it keeps happening around the world, so please miss me with your ""don't paint the whole community with the same brush"" bits. Where is the community? This is not the first time this has happened in the world. Like they say in Germany: if there's a Nazi at the table and ten people sitting and talking to them, you've got a table with 11 Nazis.

Edit: arguments are just getting repetitive now in the comments. You can read the comments if you like. 

Do i think every person of X fictitious cult is evil or brain-dead or silent? Of course not. Most people are decent and horrified. Or at least many. 

Do i think that within different sky daddy cults, different kinds of problems exist? Obviously. 

Why i find this different is as follows:

I haven't yet come across a fictional cult where the ""crime"" of being an infidel is beheading or something similarly violent. Or one where other ""crimes"" are punished in other ways that are similarly horrifying, and are also codified in their fantasy fiction.

Do other religions have violent origins? Every religion is a shitstain cult. Even today, yes. They have just over time chosen to be less violent. At least a bit. And as a community. 

Do other religions have issues of gross extremists performing forced abortions/ forcing people to give birth (YMMV) or bombings or lynchings? Obviously. They're all cults. At the same time, i don't find that other religions have these acts codified in their text and are still followed by the community without any changes. 

Most Christians accept the horrifying violence Christians before them did. We don't hear any longer of people being drawn and quartered, or women being burnt alive. 

In fact, we don't hear of women being burnt alive in Hinduism either. Because the community followed the law which outlawed the practice. 

Does this mean everything is perfect? Obviously not. What it seems to mean is that there are and have been for some years vocal voices within these religions that actively campaign against the violent aspects of their own religions. 

Anyway these conversations are getting repetitive as i said, so I'm muting this. Please make sure people around you are safe. Irrespective of their community. ‚úåÔ∏è",249,0,1656428999.0,Gil-GaladWasBlond,1656439623.0,negative,negative,negative,negative

This is clearly going to inspire a bunch of retaliatory and copycat attacks across the country. And it will continue in an endless loop. 

I wonder how disconnected from reality one has to get to do something like this. I recently had a conversation with my Muslim colleague who admitted that a predilection for violence is very common in Muslim circles. It is a problem and we need a solution (as we need one for Hindutva). 

I do not want to vilify communities but honestly it is high time for sensible and progressive Indian muslims to reclaim the narrative from these violent bastards! Or am I too naive in thinking this is even possible?

I see many of my fellow Hindu-background peers being vocal about liberal ideas, but not enough from Muslim peers. This needs to begin asap.

Yes. Like people of other communities do when some dumbass from their religion does violent shit claiming it to be an action motivated by that religion. 

Christians talk about witch burning all the time. They actually talk about their violent past constantly. Even their prominent people apologise to long dead people for crimes against them... You can literally Google Papal apologies, one was even recently made to Indigenous communities. 

And yes Hindus do it too. You can see it on all sorts of social media posts. But you know what else you can see? You can see laws in India codified against actual Hindu religious practices and scripture. That Hindus accept as reforms. Killing off women after their husbands died was outlawed. The caste system was outlawed, and even though many practice it (across religions actually, not just in Hinduism) we are taught in schools that this is bad and illegal. Untouchability was outlawed. Section 377 was overturned. In a country full of Hindus, if Hindus didn't allow this to happen, it would not. 

So please, stfu and stop being a beheading apologist. Wtf. And definitely stop saying ohh, well no other religion takes responsibility for crimes committed because of stuff written in their books.

> If you‚Äôre all unitedly and unequivocally Muslim when you speak out on socials against post 9/11 islamophobia ... then

This isn't mathematics to make transitive statements like these; that if A > B and B > C, then surely A > C. Well, yes. But that's not how things work. For example, the Indian people aren't one single entity, but you'd find them banding together quite often... you bet they appear to others as one. But for all intents and purposes, they aren't.

>  I don‚Äôt see how you can suddenly become large and fragmented and disorganized

Mate, this is evident everywhere; from Iran and Saudia being at each others throats, to the Turks and the Kurds being at it, to Yemen and UAE, to Shia and Sunnis, to Shias within themselves... No one is making this shit up.

> Plus, it‚Äôs not like you can‚Äôt create change within your individual Muslim community

Well, wouldn't you be surprised that not all Muslims are the same. If you think otherwise, then you should go out and meet them. There are all different shades of them. Even if you can't relate, think about some of famous Muslims you might know (like, Zinedine Zidane, Shah Rukh Khan, Muhammad Ali, Paul Pogba) and try to *project* whatever image you have about Muslims in your head on to them. I am not saying extremism doesn't exist. What I am saying is the broad stroke generalization doesn't hold.

> I didn‚Äôt speak to every single Hindu, I spoke to any Hindu I could reasonably have access to.

Well, it isn't like Hindus didn't vote Pragya Thakur to power. This isn't some sheep herding where you get everyone in line with a couple of dogs or sheer will or what-have-you.

I don‚Äôt know about Christianity, but its is definitely not true for Hindus. And everyone who is honest knows this. Killing due to blasphemy in India are mostly committed by Hindus. Cows are sacred in Hinduism. In the Vedas, the oldest of the Hindu scriptures, the cow is associated with Aditi, the mother of all the gods. To protect their religion, a sacred symbol (say maybe like the prophet for Muslims), many cow vigilantes started Cow protection into their own hands and as result beat or lynched many. Victims are mostly Muslims, who are seen as doing a type of blasphemy. More people who have been killed for blasphemy in India by Hindu hands (obviously since they are 80% of the population) than by Indian Muslim. There have been at least 24 people lynched by mobs in day light.

However, as I'm sure you'll see in any other comments I've made, there are various examples of both Christianity and Hinduism becoming less violent over time through choice. 

I don't see any reason to restrict the actions to India only. Religion is a disease spread across the globe. 

Christians for example do not draw and quarter people any more for crimes against their religion. There are no more witch burnings. Papal apologies have been issued to Jewish people, Muslim people, and indigenous people for various reasons. 

Hindus have accepted legislation or actively legislated against primarily hindu practices such as Sati, or untouchability, or caste system. Are these fool proof? Obviously not. The culture hasn't changed. But there are laws against these things and people who practice them can be persecuted. Dowry is another cultural practice that has been legislated against, although that's there in all communities. Divorce was legalised for Hindus even though there is no such practice allowed in the religion.

Over time these religions have allowed themselves to change, though obviously there are people who do the violent and disgusting shit. 

Now please tell me, over time, what has changed in islamic practice or how have countries that follow Islamic law changed their own laws so that they are ""better"" than whatever is written in the book or is widely practiced by adherents? 

The first beheading i knew about was Daniel Pearl, to give you an idea about the timeline I'm aware of. I came to know about Female Genital Mutilation about 16-17 years ago from a book set in KSA. I also came to know about women being at the mercy of male relatives around that time, without recourse to law. Or about women being charged for being rape victims. Or stoning. Some of these things are scripture and others are cultural practices. 

I obviously do not think any individual is responsible for these. But i do want to know whether thought leaders have spoken against things specially part of the religion, and whether anything has changed.

Again, i don't hold any one individual responsible. I believe reformist action comes from community leaders and through community action to reject regressive practices over time. Beheading people is not a new practice in the religion, and there have been more than enough calls around India for beheading Nupur Sharma... And not once have I heard anyone condemning this or calling for these people to be arrested (may have happened, please tell me if it did). There were even school girls sloganeering about beheading. So why is it so surprising that these two men thought it was okay to behead someone?
