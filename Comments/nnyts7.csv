Doraemon

Beyblade

Shin chan

Ninja hatorri

Pokémon 

Digimon

Are Japanese shows that have carried a lot of Indian childhoods.

gzxwezg,"It's not that India doesn't have good literature. There are different sets of problems :-

1) Lack of awareness. I'm a big time comic/manga/anime lover. Recently I've discovered Indian comics as well.
They are generally written in Hindi, English ,Bengali translated in English as I can't read Bengali.
Tbh I love them. We actually have humourous toons (Supandi, Tantri the Mantri, Nante Fonte, Rappa Ray, Chacha Chaudhary), great superhero(Doga being my favourite), great innovative characters (professor Shonku, Feluda, Kaka Babu). I've been recently introduced with modern Bengali literature shockingly by some of my French friends here in my work place. I think it's a godown of Innovative ideas especially works by Ray. I've been exploring more and more into modern Regional literature and I can guarantee that there's no scarcity of good literature.

2) The entertainment industry doesn't backup these Indian toons. Looks like their main motive is to dumb down the public and this has started since Ekta Kapoor stepped in. Chota Bheem has to be the dumbest shit I've ever watched. 

3) Honestly I wouldn't care about quality of animation much if the content is good. Even simple animation can create wonder if the concept is good. So the budget issue isn't really the question. It's about the motive. The Indian public has been dumbed down since last 20 years.

I learnt animation because I was annoyed by Indian animation from a young age and wanted ro change everything. It was stupid of me. I pitched a Ramayan animated series with actual action and better animation but the company said ""Kids don't have the attention span to keep up with the story so we give them 10 min episodes which have individual stories"". They don't intend to change and it's very disappointing for me. I don't have the kind of funds to start my own company and take a risk like that.

When I was a kid I was glued to the Cartoon Network channel all day and would even  watch repeated TV shows. That was quality content with brilliant animation. Every frame was individually drawn to create that effect. Like Popeye, Tom and Jerry, Dragon Balls etc.   
But bad time started when CartoonNetwork was replaced by CN. I don't know why it happened (may be because of the rights issue) but the cartoons after it was a major difference. The Old cartoon shows were being replaced by new shitty content. It was shit because the animation was dull and it looked like little or no effort was put in, it is just computer animated content (which never equalled a hand drawn animation). 

Even at that time Indian cartoons were out of the picture. They started featuring way later in pogo, jetix etc. I never was an enthusiast for Indian cartoon.

gzxi2en,"Well there are a few reasons for this : the animation companies are underpaid, Animation as a skill that could help you pursue a career is not seen that way in India i.e. we have way less people working in the animation industry + the TV channels just use old anime shows from like the 80s-90s and keep repeating them since its TV. Indian TV be it cable or set top box has become the same repeated boring shit, getting a streaming service subscription like Disney+ or HBO max is much much better these days.   


A streaming service subscription means :  
 a) you don't need a TV watch, you can watch on a PC or a Mac or an Android or an IOS device   
b) they have a plethora of content unlike the limited repeated old content TVs have   
c) some services like Disney+ and HBO max have exclusivity for certain movies due to being owned by Disney and WB. I am not sure but Paramount Plus has some exclusivity as well.  
d) you can watch whatever you want, whenever you want i.e. you aren't forced to a strict schedule, you wanna watch a show at the middle of the night no problem, wanna pause that show and watch a movie no problem. In fact just before S2 of Mandalorian I binge watched S1 at like late nights after work, now if it were a TV show instead then you would have to stick to a schedule that could interfere with your work   
e) they generally have better programming (higher quality content and they keep on producing either new shows or new seasons since they need to keep their customers)  
f) for what you are getting streaming services are a great value for the price they charge.  


Also most of the animation in foreign countries evolved from Comics, in India we had comic series like Shaktiman, a Parle G super hero boy (I am not kidding, I had read an issue of this long time ago), Chacha Chaudhry and Saabu, a Standalone Saabu Series as well and Motu Patlu. As far as I know Shaktiman was the only proper modern superhero series India had, Chacha Chaudhry wanted to be a comedic sherlock holmes and rest of the comics were generally comedic.  


Also I have observed a pattern in the Indian comics + animation that tend to be popular with the Indian demographic is that not a lot of them have original ideas and all of them in a way or another try to enforce the old traditional Hindu Society values. Indians are the only bunch who think its necessary to mix everything with a tad bit of religion, Japanese Anime rarely ever mention religion and sticks generally to the theme, so do American comics. But Indian comics or Movies, in action movies also it is necessary for the directors to include a scene of a temple or a mosque or a gurudwara.

Unless Indians put their religion behind them and think as Indians rather than as Hindu, Muslim or Sikh or whatever we will never get rid of this ideology.",299,0,1622337408.0,,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

gzy4olv,"I remember Pogo had M.A.D and Gali Gali Sim Sim(Hindi version of Sesame Street). I also used to watch Beakman's World when it used to air in Cartoon Network. Beakman's World is how I learnt that Sun is a star and not a planet(the dumbass 10 year old me used to think it is a planet) and really learnt some good stuff on the science topics.

Now, times have changed for the worse. I now don't see either M.A.D on children's entertainment channels nor do I see Beakman's world. Hell, I don't even see children watching Discovery or Nat Geo. I used to tune into Discovery just to watch MythBusters experiments and it was really exciting.

A good children's show purpose shouldn't be to entertain, it should also teach some good stuff to children at the same time. This is where Chhota Bheem and Oggy really falls flat. You expect me to believe some boy eating a sweet can gain superhuman strength? Are you serious?! 

As long as India doesn't think out of the box, we are still going to get the same run-down children's shows.

EDIT- When I say this, I am not against entertainment shows for children. In fact, some of the shows which were for pure entertainment are my all time favourites- Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, 1994 Spiderman, X-Men animated show, Duck tales, TaleSpin, Jungle Book and many I forget.

gzy06nf,"We are a country where 'career' means more salary and managerial positions, it is devoid of passion and dreams. Children are raised to aim for a paying corporate or government job and being an animator is a very individualistic choice. Not to forget whoever will delve into this right now will be remodeling the industry, basically. There is a high risk of failure and no-returns.

There is simply no culture that encourages hobbies and creativity unless they give easy returns and quick money. I see this frequently in gaming space. The lack of Indian creators is noticeable. The creator of Stardew Valley has an engineering degree too and it took him 4 years to create that game with all animations and music. Here, we'll steal API and make teen patti.

We have institutions that apparently teach students how to animate but what I've seen, it's just post-production and editing. Nolan movies and most superhero movies come to India for post production (notice the huge list of Indian names at the end of the movie) - then again its a big group of people working on same thing, created by someone else, and not making anything original. 

Hence we have TV channel produced and directed nonsense like Chhota Bheem. There's simply no funding... and production houses won't fund anything unless they think is ground breaking. Chota bheem works so it works. We don't have a dearth of artists in this country, we just cannot see them being represented for their originality, or they don't have the means to come forward on their own.

gzyf5qu,"Outsider American here: There are a few things that needs to be said about the culture and history of America and Japan.

The first is that Japan is a little more open and appreciative of drawn art and Manga since it is tied a bit to their history and culture, their theater “kabuki” is also more exaggeration. That being said, not all of Japan watches Anime 24/7, there are a number of great sitcoms and dramas that they also watch as well. 

We also have to acknowledge that not all anime’s are good and there can be some really crappy ones that don’t live as long as well.

The Same goes for the US. Marvel and DC and major entertainment companies but they only gained mainstream attention in the last 15 years. Before that, it was hard to find anyone that knew about Ironman or the flash before that, which only changed due to the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies being a success, leading to the MCU.

The US has TONS of garbage television that is forgettable and cringe. Most notably however more and more younger children use Youtube as a media provider which leads to them watching some really dumb nonsensical crap, channels that are literally advertising toys, and people whose morals are extremely questionable.

h0jd5a3,"As an avid anime watcher (animax, jetix days) to an animator myself, it's more complicated then it seems, Indian animation industry comprises of making kids shows and need to stick to proven formulas(religious based) or intellectual property of a brand name (dabangg) etc to meet costs. 
Animation is a costly affair, Indian curriculum doesn't teach hand drawn animation which is found in anime, there aren't any good 2D schools, most animators I know freelance and are self taught, the producers don't understand how long it takes to take a show from start to finish, the studios which do exist in India either take outsourcing work from America or do small indie projects. 

Quite frankly if there was a demand for good story from Indian audience , we would get high quality shows but not at the level of anime or castlevania etc

h0s8mfw,"Tbh I kinda liked chhota bheem's first 2 seasons or the very early/beginning episodes of the show. There was something unique about it , the art style was quite unique if we take the fact that at that time it was an emerging cartoon show on television which was not a Japanese anime . It was very different from the other japanese shows ( in the sense of the story , the characters & the basic humor they had ) . The one thing I liked about the first show was that the art style was really good but ofcourse the animations were really bad still it was manageable for a kid and they really had some good stories.

But the new show or the shows that they made after gaining some popularity is really hecked up . I mean they added mythological characters & added modern technological instruments in a place where you would find most houses made up of mud and other stuffs like that ( which Questions the timeline very much ). Even after gaining so much popular they neither changed their bad laggy animations nor their stories. Their movie ideas were taken from other shows and movies and never had their own unique stories.

gzyb7bj,"This. The sole purpose of Animes in Japan is to promote and boost the sales of its source materials. This is the reason many anime aren't adapted till the ending because the producers started the anime only with a target sales figures for its manga/Light Novel on their mind and often they ditch the project once they obtain that. Moodern literature and animation industry are so interwined in Japan. But in our country, people who are in the media industry presently perhaps aren't even aware of our own modern literature fictions. I am a Bengali and yes we have some aweome fictional characters in our modern literature. Some of them even have seen the light of animated adaptation on our regional tv channels. They used to air back when I was in my primary school 13-14 years ago. And kids of my age actually watch them. We would discuss those shows with friends in school. There was the hype. Back to present days, one of my cousins who is around 14 years old now, is only aware of Bheem, Raju, Motu, Patlu in the name of fictional Indian characters. I am sure other regional literature also have something good to offer. The media industry either is or chose to be unaware of them. Another thing, the culture of magazines and serialized novels which was much more popular when I was a kid/early teen. 'Anandamela' is a magazine targeted at kids and early teenagers which used to have original short-stories, comics and sometimes comic adaptations of original classic/modern novels. These days, the quality and active readers both have decreased. One of the reasons Anime industry is so successful is Manga being much more popular and mainstream than Anime inside Japan. So when a production house announces the anime adaptation of a popular manga series, the fans and followers of the manga gets hyped up to see their favorite characters animated. This hype then reaches the rest of the world where animes are more mainstream. And that's how you get shows like Jujutsu Kaisen which gains massive popularity within very short timespan. Reading stories and comics have become alien idea to present day children of our country. So even if someone makes a tv adaptation of, say Ghanada for example(a great fictional character in Bengali) it would be hard for the producers to make it an anticipated show.

gzy8hho,"Among Bengali literature, the works of Satyajit Ray are well known. He has written books for children and produced many movies corresponding to the books. A popular fantasy movie series directed by him is the Gupi Bagha trilogy. These are not animated ones, but they have some special effects which were far ahead of their times. For example, [this video](https://youtu.be/L-8yaZIFIQc) analyzes how the first movie achieves the special effects, even though it was the era of black and white movies without computers. In my childhood, my favorite movie was the second part of the trilogy - Hirak Rajar Deshe. After I grew up, I realized that the movie had a separate meaning for the adult folks, and it conveyed excellent social commentary which continues to be relevant even today. 

But the Bengali literature is not confined to the works of Ray. Shirshendu has written a plethora of children's literature under the 'Advuture' series. The novels in this series are an amazing mix of humour, science fiction, and ghosts. It almost seems ridiculous how aliens and ghosts can be written in the same novel, but he does it with a lot of style and humor. Many of his works have been converted to comics and movies, though most might remain inaccessible to the non bengalis. 

Among humorous literature, the works of Shibram Chakraborty and Narayan Gangopdhyay are quite prominent. Their works have also been adapted into comics, cartoons and movies. I would rate their humor to be of a similar grade as ""Three men in a boat"". Some of their works have been translated, though I did not read those myself, and I am not sure whether the Bengali word plays could be properly translated in English. The cartoons for Tenida written by Narayan Gangopadhyay are available on YouTube, and the content is good and humorous. However, they need to be dubbed in order to reach a broader audience. 

Among science fiction, most people are aware of Professor Shonku written by Ray. But few non-bengalis have heard the name of Adrish Bardhan. He has written a vast amount of science fiction literature that ranges from alien invasion to time travel. I recently purchased an omnibus by him, and realized that the huge volume contains an unimaginable diversity of plots. If a movie director wishes for fresh ideas for sci-fi movies, he would never run out of new plots. These works absolutely need to be made into movies or animated cartoons.

""Yugo Sako proposed the idea of an animated Ramayana to the VHP and the government. He told them that animation was a serious art form in Japan and it would help bring the Ramayana to a wider global audience. The Government agreed initially, but later declined his proposal for a bi-nation collaboration, saying the Ramayana is a very sensitive subject and cannot be portrayed as a cartoon. Also, the fact that the movie was being made at the height of the Ayodhya dispute, added to the controversy and axed the prospects of producing it in India. With no choice and support left, the movie was ultimately produced in Japan with nearly 450 artists from both nations contributing to its creation.""",1,1,1622527021.0,RiverStone_8,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral

>Also I have observed a pattern in the Indian comics + animation that tend to be popular with the Indian demographic is that not a lot of them have original ideas and all of them in a way or another try to enforce the old traditional Hindu Society values. 
Indians are the only bunch who think its necessary to mix everything with a tad bit of religion

I don't mind religion but can they atleast put some effort/class into their animation? Why is animation still considered a medium just for kids?They ""respect"" religion so much yet are content with making trash animation on a shoestring budget, why not try to make something on the level of say, Pixar and ufotable? (they are surely keen on spending crores on 'world class special effect movies' like Robo  2 /Bahuubali)

I have also noticed that villains in Indian animation always job, are always 100% comically evil(and inept)and the protagonists are basically just OnePunchMan. The threat of the villain is never established, they are just ""the bad guys"".

There are so many shows on the same religious/mythological figures, why don't shows try to do things differently with the stories to stand out, like say, making the fights more over-the-top/stylistic(like DBZ/One Piece, there are plenty of characters from Indian mythos who can qualify for such sequences)? 

>Japanese Anime rarely ever mention religion and sticks generally to the theme,

Depends on the anime but this is generally not true. Japanese anime(and games, manga, novels, etc) have plenty of religious and cultural references/themes spread throughout their shows (like the obligatory shrine visits, worshipping the local god/making wishes to them/festivals, gods and mythological characters showing up as actual characters in the shows/having techniques named after them, etc).

That said, I have also noticed they have a good deal of disdain for religion(including their own), one example of this: plenty of shows and games showcase some religious figure/cult/church as one of major enemies OR the final enemy (i.e. the church is secretly controlling people/brainwashing them/summoning monsters or the demon lord to remake the world and bring ""salvation"", etc)",35,1,1622342536.0,biryaniwala,1622343009.0,negative,negative,neutral,negative

h00i5o4,True. I think sticking to Mythology is really limiting the possibilities of so many cultural influences which can seep into stories. Even though it's not an anime; Tumbaad fits the bill perfectly. It is able to blend this fantasy element which is kind of mythological in nature and tell. A great story about greed. I think it's storyboard looked like a graphic novel! There are so many other possibilities. One more direction I have been thinking about is using animation to tell stories about real places but capture it in a form that only animation can do. Like how Shinkai does in his movies. He makes so many places in Japan look more beautiful than they really are by the usage of lights and colors.

For both Marvel & DC comics from the US and for anime like Naruto and One Piece from Japan, the target audience are kids.
The Japanese anime genre that Naruto, DBZ and One Piece come under is named Shonen, which basically means that it is for young boys (there is a girl alternative too).
So when anime like Naruto are made, the main audience that is in mind are 11-14 year old boys.
And if the audience beyond that finds interest in the story then it is because of its quality.
The same is for American superhero comics.

The adult audience for both anime and Comics comes from two things-

1.	People who grew up with it and watch it again for nostalgia.
2.	People who found out about it and watch it because it’s good in their opinion.

Indian cartoons like Chota Bheem are aimed at kids, but they fail in all aspects to get to the non-target audience and are even losing out on their target audience.
How?

1.	The people who watched it as kids are embarrassed to even admit that they watched it.
2.	No sane adult could watch it and like it.

3.	And lastly, with Indian kids having access to American and Japanese content, there is a mass exodus from Indian cartoons to foreign alternatives.

gzyaw9v,"So I'm currently studying animation and it's kind of a known fact at this point in the industry that a lot of kids in India find aural comedy much more funnier than visual comedy.

My speculation is that Hindi Comedy films often do rely on exaggerated dialogues rather than visual slapstick. For example, Rom Coms in India like the first Chashme Badoor, a more recent example like Hera Pheri are much more popular as comedy than slapstick visual comedy in the West like Charlie Chaplin or Mr Bean.

Which is why a lot of hindi dubs for western cartoons do have overly exaggerated dialogues. For example if Shin Chan was directly translated from it's japanese dialogues, it wouldn't have been such a big hit as it was with it's hindi dub which was honestly much more creative as it gave much more personality to the characters, and I'd definitely say that Shin Chan's hindi dub made a very big impact on how Indian Cartoon are written",56,3,1622357740.0,spitclapboom,1622408953.0,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

And the way it was structured; it didn't feel like the frames were not moving. If you haven't I would recommend you to check it out! It inspired me to think of story ideas which can be adapted to animation without a lot of resources. His understanding of lighting,contrast,shadows was very good way back then. Even in black and white with minimal animation using after effects etc he was able to get a very good output. It also showed his abilities which later came to the fore with 5 cms per second etc. I guess probably with the industry being the way it is; that could be a possibile way forward with adapting a story with the limitations in mind but still capture people's imagination and get some traction.

This could also be because Indian Cinema only really became mainstream post British Rule, while Western Film had much more time. 

As for things like stand up comics, it's not something that a family would sit and watch as compared to family friendly comedic films, so I don't think a lot of animations catered towards children would take inspiration from them? 

Dialogue comedy in the west has mainly catered towards a certain demographic of teenage and young adult while in India, due to a difference in culture, even children are used to watching dialogue heavy shows, this might be changing with shows like Motu Patlu which does use more slapstick but that show has a whole other set of problems lmao",1,5,1622371785.0,spitclapboom,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

Translation: Then, Mantharak had a chat with his barber friend about ""consulting his wife"". The barber said it was contrary to good judgement to consult with women. He consented that, ""Women are often selfish. They cannot think of anything except their pleasure. Even when they love their sons, they only do so in expectation of happiness from them in future.""
