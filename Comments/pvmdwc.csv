2. if part of your scale is over the edge of the table, you can use one finger to lift your scale touching only the exposed part, and attempt to push the other scale off the map like a fucking crane.

hebpcth,"Lol this reminds me. Back in school, pen fight was pretty much a boy's only game and the girls in my class were often annoyed by it since we sometimes accidentally flicked our pens towards them when the pens were flicked too hard. One of the girls though, was fascinated by the art of penfighting one day. 

She came to our table and started watching, she just observed for a few days. After that, she said she wanted to play. Since it was her first time, one of the rookies volunteered to fight. 

The girl took out the most glorious  weapen we had ever seen. It had multiple grips and wings and somehow was also aerodynamically sound. She had a huge collection of pens, as did most girls in our class in those days. Of every kind, glitter, gel, clickable blah blah. This girl realized the value of her vast inventory that lied unused. Unlike our aesthetically poor pens, her pens had the best of both worlds. Form and function. Colours were matched, stickers and glitter, covered with plastic film. It was the next generation, Like the apple of weapens. 

She carefully placed the pen on one end of the table and it was an ace, her first flick perfectly transferred the momentum to the opponent's pen and it flew across the room while the sturdy grips kept the winning pen still on table. All of us were equal parts impressed and scared as she had something we all thought was invincible. 

Anyway, she made her way up the ladder and finally beat the reigning champion. Eventually the game got banned in our school and she just became a legend of the yesteryears. I still wonder what happened to her. We didn't have facebook back in those days to keep in touch and all I remember of her is her ultimate weapen.",246,1,1632645312.0,LittleOneInANutshell,False,neutral,positive,positive,positive
