g5swvrl,"I don't know about the unfortunate part since it's fortunate that we chose english over some other language which would be pretty dumb. It's the language of science. So you would have people learn the language irrespective of their own tongue even where there isn't a need for a common tongue. 

For example it would be dumb to choose a language other than English. Example: Indonesia chose malay which is pretty dumb 'cause now they have to learn English, for its economic benefits, together with malay and their mother tongue (which they may stop learning). This could potentially wipe out their local languages in the longer run.",1,7,1600512939.0,,False,neutral,negative,neutral,neutral
