The best students obviously got 80lac-1cr packages but the rest (read majority ~60-70%) followed the management pipeline and currently make excel sheets and ppts in their day job. That uses <1% of the mental rigor than the last 8-10 years of their student life.

And to top it all, all of this came at a cost of critical social skill development. When you're a teenager you have so many thoughts about changing bodies, attraction, communication with the opposite gender etc. But we're brainwashed that it's bad and we need to sacrifice everything in the name of IIT/medicine.

Physics on Wed and Sat evenings with an almost-blind retired physics teacher. he could barely see and would have to press his face to the board to draw out force body diagrams. He conducted the classes out of his tiny bedroom that he had converted to a classroom. An uncomfortable bench, a dim light, and a blackboard inside the room inside his brother's house. It felt weird entering a stranger's house, then sneaking into this room and spending 2-3 hours understanding crazy physics concepts.

Maths was with an eccentric retired maths professor who lived a happy life. He visited the US for 3 months a year and taught the reminder of his time. Two one hour sessions Mondays and Fridays. We could pick 6-7am or 6-7pm. It was a hike from school (which ended at 4PM). And there were no buses, so I sat in the carrier of my friend's bicycle and dragged my tired ass to his lectures. They were fun, but his homework was a mountain to get through.

Chemistry was one lump - Sunday 6-9AM both organic and inorganic. Two professors shuttled back and forth in that slot. Their MO was - here, take these 100 problems and solve it by next Sunday. And during the class, they went through each problem and solved it. They held their classes in a government school. I had to get up at 4:45 (and eat Maggi that mom made) before taking a long bus ride to the nearest stop and then walk half an hour through sewage infested slums. I hated chemistry classes and the subject. I knew it will never have any bearing in my professional life and didn't see the point of it.

While all of this was happening, I had to juggle my school syllabus.

I didn't have a life. I didn't have sleep. It was a blur of academics and studying. In the end I didn't get into IIT and I didn't care, but I persisted for 2 years and gave it my all.",49,1,1663177344.0,SabashChandraBose,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

Tuitions in such places are typically aimed towards remedial students who are having a hard time and need the extra attention.   And contrary to what some whatsapp university grads believe, engineers and scientists in western countries are just as smart as those in India.  I believe this whole tuition culture that exists in India, China, Japan, Korea, etc. is the result of predatory academies taking advantage of parents' fears that their children will perform badly and thus never be successful.  Also, of course, the education system is also far more hierarchical and honestly outdated.  It's a very unhealthy form of competition and creates a culture of narcissism, backstabbing, and depression.  And you have children who simply did well on a standardized test being lauded as some kind of national heroes, just to further emotionally blackmail future test takers and their parents.
