jxf0jtk,"Let me put forth some key points : 

1. India did this using the “slingshot” mechanism. Instead of using launchers which can put Chandrayaan at 11.2km/s, ISRO very cleverly used the Earth’s and Moon’s gravitational fields to achieve this. 
2. Landing on the South Pole has been a totally different challenge due to very difficult terrains. ISRO has done excellent work here to ensure the landing is done in a safe spot by comparisons with reference maps of the moon Chandrayaan 3 had on board. 
3. Needless to say, we are the first country to land on the South Pole. This is expected to give us interesting insights on water/frozen ice on the moon, apart from other analysis the rover does 
4. All this was done at a cost potentially lower than a high end Hollywood movie. 

I can only marvel at the fact that you can only land on the moon (or any entity in space) purely using science & calculations , because you can’t physically be there “driving” the device. An amazing feat.",50,0,1692801039.0,Ill-Afternoon7161,False,neutral,positive,positive,positive

jxexopt,"This is huge for India. All the moon landings so far have been in the moon's equatorial region. The surface is relatively smooth, there's an abundance of sunlight and the temperature is favourable to the optimal functioning of the on board instruments.

The lunar south has been in perpetual darkness, filled with massive craters and unfavourable temperatures for proper functioning of instruments. Which is why the total mission duration is 1 lunar day or 14 earth days since the equipment will start to deteriorate due to the harsher environment.

Also, NASA's Artemis-1 Mission costs a whopping $4 billion to just put a module in orbit. ISRO's Chandrayaan-3 has put a module in orbit and landed on the 'dark side of the moon' in a mere $80 million.",67,0,1692799904.0,currymunchah,False,positive,neutral,neutral,neutral

jxeotky,"Landing on the south pole and exploring it is crucial for future space missions not just for India but for the whole world due to several reasons.  


1. **Water Ice Deposits**: The South Pole has potential water ice, which can support life and be used as resources forrocket fuel.
2. **Scientific Exploration**: Its unique environment offers insights into lunar geology and solar system history.
3. **Strategic Location**: Areas of near-constant sunlight can provide continuous solar power, ideal for a lunar base.
4. **Gateway to Deep Space**: The South Pole can serve as a launch point for missions to Mars and beyond.
5. **Economic Potential**: Resource extraction, like water, offers economic opportunities.
6. **International Collaboration**: The region can foster global partnerships in space exploration.  


Despite whatever differences people have, chandrayan-3 provides India with an unprecedented competitive advantage on gathering data for assessing future deep-space exploration.

jxf5mhg,"Hi, sorry for my pedestrian knowledge on this matter. But I am bit confused about this .. 

Please, I am not trying to come across as downplaying the achievement but really want to honestly understand what makes this such a historic event.

We already had Mangalyan few years ago which went all the way to Mars. If we achieved that .. then Moon should be a more easier challange, right ?

And first landing on moon was done like 50-60 years ago .. So what are we aiming to learn from this landing ?

And why this sudden rush for moon .. like us and Russia both were going for it at the same time. I thought Mars is what the world was interested in, but surprised to see the sudden surge in moon .. what gives ?

Once again apologies for my ignorant statements, I fully love when our country does well, especially in the field of science which is the need of the hour .. but I genuinely would like a ELI5 for this to appreciate better.

Not to forget, we spend money on our problems, way more than what we spent on this moon landing. Just that, 1.4 billion people are never going to be the easiest to deal with, and given the amount of problems the west has with its little population, I guess Indians have a great chance of surprising you with their survival.

I had typed this because I remembered part of the original comment as Indian leadership has more south Indians but then realised that wasn't what the comment was.

Latest edit: In case anyone is wondering, OP edited their comment previously stating that ISRO is proof that India needs more south Indians in leadership positions for the country to prosper.


Message to OC: You can enjoy the country's achievements without breaking people down into south Indians, north Indians, gender, etc. There's no facts, just stupid patterns you make up in your head to justify your narrow world view.

Yeah! Screw all the telemetry that this ""animation"" represents, its just a cartoon. /s

&#x200B;

I have some time, so I will explain the real reason. Footage from our camera (best ever sent to the moon by any country), is very data heavy. It is almost impossible to transmit that data live or even in couple of hours. To transmit that sort of data, it takes a long time and plus the satellite communication needs to be extended. This can only happen after landing. 

In comparison, the animation you see is a software that takes data from sensors (very small sizes of data) and creates a graphic so that layman like you can understand exactly where the spacecraft is. 

So the thing is, we can basically know whether the craft landed or not based on the latter. So if we wait for the 'real footage' to celebrate. We will pretty much know beforehand what has happened. Which is awkward to say the least. 

The broadcast you see is the from the control center, these experts arent going to wait so that layman like you can see the 'real footage' to celebrate, when their sensor data tells them it already has landed.

jxhiiq1,"If the US is planning to build a base on the moon don't you think they could land a rover on the moon?

The reason OP states that India out-tech-ed Russia is because Russia just had one of their spacecraft crash land into the moon trying to reach the south pole. They failed where India succeeded. 

This is not the case for the US where NASA has been landing rovers all over the solar system for decades now. NASA plans to make the moon a base of operations to eventually land humans on Mars. Not a rover, human beings.

If India had that level of technology and expertise they would have landed on the south pole of the moon with a manned crew of astronauts.

I am not saying that this is not an accomplishment, this is huge for India and the space community only benefits from India's advancement.",1,2,1692834821.0,ThermalPaper,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral

Its possible. Not probable. 

Its just as possible that we are all living in a simulation made by a higher dimensional being named Elon Musk for his high school project. 

>What does going to the moon even accomplish right now? 

A lot of things. Mainly boils down to 2 things though. Scientific research and expanded space exploration capabilities. Moon has a 16% weaker gravity and no atmosphere.

I kind of view all space exploration as kind of pointless right now with the current tech, what tangible benefit does this have for the everyday citizen? Seems it'd be more beneficial to pause space travel and make sure everyone on earth is taken care of first, then when the tech is actually ready for deep space travel we focus on that.",1,3,1692813533.0,WashingtonRefugee,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
