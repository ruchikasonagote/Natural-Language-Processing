h75zpt7,"Our school only had the sports period for name sake . Every 9/10 times the period would be taken by other subject teacher. Also the remaining time if we got that sports period , the dumbass teacher would show up half an hour late and he told full energetically COME ON CLASS FORM HEIGHTWISE LINE and when we almost reached the ground the bell rang for another period.

h76tlbi,"It pains me as I type this but we under-invest and under-inspire people in almost all fields, it's not a lack of talent given our numbers but it's most likely due to us as a country not being able to inspire and support people to do almost anything, I'm sure if we had enough resources to support them they would've probably stayed here. 

Typically most of the people who go with sciences are the ones who couldn't make it to engineering or medicine and these people take up teaching jobs at schools and universities and bring the same old mediocre attitude even at Tire-1 institutes. I'm sure there are a few educators and researchers who are really awesome but one or two oddballs won't be enough to inspire thousands of students, and even the ones who get inspired by them go on to pursue research abroad.

As for sports, people and families need money to survive and playing sports won't feed the family so unless there's a way for the athlete's family to make ends meet no matter how talented he/she is they are not going to pursue that as a career especially when there's no one to motivate and inspire them otherwise.  


had his brother not been there to support their family do you think he would've been able to pursue the sport? luckily for him, he had a supporting brother and a motivating coach.

Sure. How about we look at addressing malnutrition before that? Around 40 percent of Indian children are stunted and will never be able to reach their full potential of development. Surely addressing that is a better use of money than building sports infrastructure for the entrainment of the middle class.

h77zwti,"It's mostly - Read tl;dr if this is too long an explanation

1) lack of care for anything other than studies as a child. Literally nothing else matters, unless you're privileged (not poor, live in an urban area), have ""progressive"" parents, or are extremely, extremely lucky and talented.

2) the need to get a job and take care of your parents (because you are your parents' retirement plan, unlike the most first world countries)

3) Lack of infrastructure

I'd say that China faces exactly the same problems as we do in terms of population and points 1&2, but they get results in the Olympics because they **WANT** to be competitive at it. They want the medals, and it becomes a thing of prestige for them. Similar to how if the USA didn't get as many gold medals, it would become somehow shameful, being the world leader. I don't know how Chinese internal sports politics works, but they definitely at least WANT to produce results at the Olympics and made the infrastructure to support it. Whereas in India:-

* No one gives a fuck about how India is viewed in the world stage.
* Anything that becomes ""worthy"" of pride and is ever-so-slightly connected to India automatically is viewed as an **Indian achievement.** Why? Because people are retarded. Good examples would be Sundar Pichai and Kamala Harris. 

I'm pretty sure if an American person became the President, and 10,000 years ago, one of their progenitors descended from the Indus Civilization or whichever civilization we Indians are from, Indians would be proud that an ""Indian"" became an ""American"" President.
