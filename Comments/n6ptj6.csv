[Congress Party voter-list use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_anti-Sikh_riots#Congress_Party_voter-list_use)

'On 31 October, Congress Party officials provided assailants with voter lists, school registration forms, and ration lists. The lists were used to find Sikh homes and business, an otherwise-impossible task because they were in unmarked, diverse neighbourhoods. During the night of 31 October, before the massacres began, assailants used the lists to mark Sikh houses with an ""S"". Because most mob members were illiterate, Congress Party officials provided help reading the lists and leading the mobs to Sikh homes and businesses in other neighbourhoods. With the lists, the mobs could pinpoint the location of Sikhs they otherwise would have missed.

Sikh men not at home were easily identified by their turbans and beards, and Sikh women were identified by their dress. In some cases, the mobs returned to locations where they knew Sikhs were hiding because of the lists. Amar Singh escaped the initial attack on his house by having a Hindu neighbour drag him into the neighbour's house and announce that he was dead. A group of 18 assailants later came looking for his body; when his neighbour said that his body had been taken away, an assailant showed him a list and said: ""Look, Amar Singh's name has not been struck off from the list, so his body has not been taken away.""

gxaaq1z,"Why is getting, or not getting the vaccine anyone's business? Those who don't want the vaccine let them take the risk. Those who want the vaccine let them take the risk. Americans are becoming so far removed from ""mind your business"" that people actually think their self-justified brown noses are essential to save humanity. We're over here talking about save the world, reduce carbon emissions, save the wildlife, and so on but here we are so preoccupied with saving another humans life. Let people take the risks as they please so selection can take its course.

I really don't want to hear the whole bullshit excuse of ""Well if they get Covid they are exposing the rest of us"" for a number of reasons. #1 it's none of your business unless they want to share that information Northern if they, or don't take the vaccine. #2 We need a supposed population reduction to supposdly save the planet #3 You're a hypocritical, and a liar. Do you text, and drive? Do you run red/yellow lights? Do you go to work sick? Are you a consumerist? Do you eat meat? There are any number of questions that pertains to the health, ND wellbeing of our planet, and of our people.. If you answer yes to any of these, or any other number of contributions to the problems humanity has on life across the planet then you are as much an issue as anyone else. You're playing the blame game when the finger needs to be pointed at self. You're contributing to our problems just like the next man, and any man, women, or other who disagrees I would say that 98% of you are delusional, and the other 2% may be telling most of the truth. 

As someone who has been to third world countries, and seen some pretty disgusting living standards these people who do not live in bubbles are some of the most humbling people you will ever meet. How is this relevant? Americans are so far removed from struggle that we attemp to create struggle where there is none by sticking our nose in shit that doesn't pertain to us. What most of y'all are doing is creating drama for the satisfaction of your own egotistical ways on the American stage of drama. Funny thing is most of these people don't even realize how good they have it. We're like spoiled children in rich families constantly complaining, and looking for a new high because everything is already provided.

I grew up in the struggle. I've gone days without eating, no heat, or hot water in Northern American winters with no jacket, and most of Americans would consider my early years ""the struggle"" but the reality of it is I had it good. For most of you who think you're struggling, you're really not you just propetuate the struggle because it seems cool from the outside. Go to a third world country, and see some real struggle, and you will quickly learn how good you have it. How is this relevant? Same as before, you create problems out of nothing because in America, and maybe other developed countries we look for excuses to turn ""the struggle"" into empowerment because we believe it to be cool. We breed our own problems out of nothing to seem relevant. We combat one another so the elites can continue to keep us under control, and docile like trained dogs.

If everyone just took a step back, and look at themselves, and look at other undeveloped countries you'll soon realize all this anti USA propaganda bullshit will cease. That your own propetuated bullshit will cease. That your dirty nose that your sticking into everyone's business should be worrying about your own, or your people to your left, and right. The fall of America will be the death of most of us, and trust me when I say only the strong, or smart will survive. If you believe yourself to be in this category you better rethink yourself, and your worth, and how iy pertains to America going from a first world to a second, or third. If you have no viable, or valuable skillets you're most likley screwed, and will be the first to fall. 

If you think the fall of America is going to bring about some new better society you're sadly mistaken. Those who control the countries, these massive companies, and those with power already will remain in power while we continue to fight for scraps. A new nation with the same elite will run the show while us common people beg for scraps. Instead of letting America fall we need to stick together, and make demands of those who make the rules, who run our lives, who keep us in check. Removing America from the map as we know it today is NOT the answer to our problems.

If you at any point in this long rant you lose track, and think it's irrelevant you've got a lot of outside the box thinking to so. You need to start thinking for yourself, and stop taking sides, and realize what is really going on. This Covid stuff is most certainly released for a power grab, and if you don't believe me make sure to remember where you heard it when you start yo realize that your freedom is being stripped from you bits at a time. You'll be sitting in a chair, old and gray telling the same stories of how ignorant you were, and how you should have done this, and that to the younger generation. How in your day you could walk down the streets without enforcement stoppung you to make sure you've got papers for the Covid vaccine, a microchip, etc.

[Congress Party voter-list use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_anti-Sikh_riots#Congress_Party_voter-list_use)

'On 31 October, Congress Party officials provided assailants with voter lists, school registration forms, and ration lists. The lists were used to find Sikh homes and business, an otherwise-impossible task because they were in unmarked, diverse neighbourhoods. During the night of 31 October, before the massacres began, assailants used the lists to mark Sikh houses with an ""S"". Because most mob members were illiterate, Congress Party officials provided help reading the lists and leading the mobs to Sikh homes and businesses in other neighbourhoods. With the lists, the mobs could pinpoint the location of Sikhs they otherwise would have missed.

This is just one public example. There are hundreds of such examples. tbh It genuinely feels like SEBI wants only foreign companies to grow because it's regulations effectively stop Indian start ups from raising capital.

And for a serious answer: we can discuss blood clots and death numbers and the value of a life all we like, but at the end of the day, 10 dead is better than a 100 dead, which is better than a 1000 dead. Its truly a tragedy that those lives were lost, and they had the right to live just as much as we do, but that shouldn't stop us from preventing more deaths. Maybe think about the bigger picture before being a self righteous asshole?

Also, those deaths were just from the AstraZeneca vaccine. (Of course, not everyone is so lucky to have options, but the rate is still incredibly low)

From a personal viewpoint: I don't mind risking blood clots/death for the vaccine. My dad had covid and suffered/is still suffering, and I don't mind vaccinating, if only to prevent more people from being in that situation.",2,9,1620384661.0,lightswan,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

Almost all the deaths reported from blood clots were below 50 years old. It seems to be totally safe for above 50 folk. Some countries have allowed AstraZ vaccines only for 55+ individuals and other vaccines for below 55.

Also, since you're against forcing people from taking a COVID vaccine (speaking of, which vaccine is the eVuL one?) I'm guessing also against forcing people to take MMR as well right? You're also against forcing people to wear seatbelts under the same prinicple, correct?

I'll be blunt: you clearly have zero idea about these things. The fact you think cancer and diabetes are diseases (hint: they're not diseases) shows just how out of your depth you are.
