- Cancer isn't a single disease. What cancers are we talking about specifically?
- Problem might not be the mercury at all, but some other pollutant.
- 250 Cancer deaths isn't necessarily a lot. What's the age of the population? On average, every fifth person (about 20%) will get some form of cancer (in western Europe). In India the number is probably a lot lower due to infant mortality and high mortality rates due to treatable conditions (infectious diseases / trauma), so a high cancer morbidity/mortality in your village could, for example, correlate with a high average age and paradoxically a particularly safe area to live...

In any case, I don't think that the Indian death rate for cancer could be as low as 0.05% unless the people were normally dying young from other diseases.

The media isn't the only solution to your problem, what you have to do is move to the Courts and fight a battle that you might not want to get yourself involved in. The easiest way is to approach an NGO that will help you go along with your claim.  DO NOT APPROACH GREENPEACE BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT THEY ARE CASH STRAPPED AND CANNOT HELP YOU. 

To prove the poisoning, the first thing that you must do is to send the water out for independent testing. The tests willl come out to be positive for mercury. You have to ensure that this test is not in any way biased. 

Go to a legal NGO that will help fight your claim. The easiest one that I know of is called the Human Rights Law Network (http://www.hrln.org/hrln/). There are other NGOs such as Lawyers Collective also that you can approach that will help fight the case *pro bono*. 

Lastly, yes, the media will help you fight your battle but you must realise that the media also has its limitations and will not help you beyond a point. The pressure that you can put on the corporates by approaching the Courts is much much higher. Insist on filing a PIL in the High Court or the Supreme Court and it will definitely get reported by the media then. You must act asap, though.

3.) [An Assessment of Thimerosal Use in Childhood Vaccines](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/107/5/1147.short) 
Conclusion. Our review revealed no evidence of harm caused by doses of thimerosal in vaccines, except for local hypersensitivity reactions. However, some infants may be exposed to cumulative levels of mercury during the first 6 months of life that exceed EPA recommendations. Exposure of infants to mercury in vaccines can be reduced or eliminated by using products formulated without thimerosal as a preservative.

4.)[Safety of Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines: A Two-Phased Study of Computerized Health Maintenance Organization Databases](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/5/1039.short)
Conclusions. No consistent significant associations were found between TCVs (Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines) and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Conflicting results were found at different HMOs for certain outcomes. For resolving the conflicting findings, studies with uniform neurodevelopmental assessments of children with a range of cumulative thimerosal exposures are needed.

5.)[Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines and Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Critical Review of Published Original Data](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/114/3/793.short)
Conclusions. Studies do not demonstrate a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD, and the pharmacokinetics of ethylmercury make such an association less likely. Epidemiologic studies that support a link demonstrated significant design flaws that invalidate their conclusions. Evidence does not support a change in the standard of practice with regard to administration of thimerosal-containing vaccines in areas of the world where they are used.

6.)[Autism and thimerosal-containing vaccines](http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(03)00113-2/abstract?cc=y=) 
Conclusions. The body of existing data, including the ecologic data presented herein, is not consistent with the hypothesis that increased exposure to Thimerosal-containing vaccines is responsible for the apparent increase in the rates of autism in young children being observed worldwide.

7.)[Early Thimerosal Exposure and Neuropsychological Outcomes at 7 to 10 Years](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa071434) 
CONCLUSION. Our study does not support a causal association between early exposure to mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines and immune globulins and deficits in neuropsychological functioning at the age of 7 to 10 years.

8.)[Thimerosal Exposure in Infants and Developmental Disorders: A Retrospective Cohort Study in the United Kingdom Does Not Support a Causal Association](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/114/3/584.short) 
Conclusions. With the possible exception of tics, there was no evidence that thimerosal exposure via DTP/DT vaccines causes neurodevelopmental disorders.

9.)[Continuing Increases in Autism Reported to California's Developmental Services System
Mercury in Retrograde](http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=482546) 
Conclusions  The DDS data do not show any recent decrease in autism in California despite the exclusion of more than trace levels of thimerosal from nearly all childhood vaccines. The DDS data do not support the hypothesis that exposure to thimerosal during childhood is a primary cause of autism.

10.)[Mercury Exposure in Children With Autistic Spectrum Disorder: Case-Control Study](http://jcn.sagepub.com/content/19/6/431.short) 
Conclusion. Thus, the results from our cohort study with similar environmental mercury exposure indicate that there is no causal relationship between mercury as an environmental neurotoxin and autism.

11.)[Prenatal and Infant Exposure to Thimerosal From Vaccines and Immunoglobulins and Risk of Autism](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/126/4/656.short) 
CONCLUSIONS: In our study of MCO members, prenatal and early-life exposure to ethylmercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines and immunoglobulin preparations was not related to increased risk of ASDs.

12.) PDF! [Does thimerosal or other mercury exposure increase the risk
for autism?](http://www.rozjec.ane.pl/pdf/7023.pdf) PDF! 
CONCLUSIONS The evidence presented here does not support the association between autism and mercury exposure from the pharmaceutical preservative thimerosal.

They all died within 24 hours. They claimed they died of meningitis and not from the toxic effects of the thiomersal, and this has been used for 50+ years to 'prove' safety. 

The CDC added the flu shot to the recommended schedule. It still has 25 micrograms of mercury. For a baby this totally violates any kind of EPA limit for mercury exposure. And the general public think it's gone from the vaccines, which is equally amazing. But given the news piece saying mercury is good for you, it's clear the media can tell the uniformed general public anything. Maybe even hire some actual criminals to produce some studies to send them to sleep.

This isn't necessarily true. There are many, many different types of cancers, and some develop and become lethal within months of exposure to certain carcinogens. Since we have no clue as to what types of carcinogens may be present, we cannot rule it out.

Lace?  How adorably dramatic!  The vaccines are not laced with mercury.  They contain thimerosal, which is made up of ethyl-mercury and a thiol group.  What you're saying is as ridiculous as saying ""you're eating chloride"" when you're actually talking about table salt.  Now, if you had actually ever taken a chemistry course, you'd understand how ridiculous you sound.

Do you even know what a bolus is, dukey?  A bolus is a dose given to raise the levels of a medication in the system to a therapeutic level.  Now, since thimerosal is not a medication, the amount in thimerosal is not a bolus.

He made the OIG top 10 list for healthcare related fraud. In his case he was embezzling the money, instead of it being used for research. But whatever, the study was fatally flawed anyway. If you want to call this a 'lie' so be it. Imagine if a study came out that showed a connection to autism, and it was headed by people like that. It would be destroyed by the media, and rightfully so. 

As for being shadow banned, well done sir. But it's trivial to create another account for posting, so it's a non issue.

>He made the OIG top 10 list for healthcare related fraud.

Not at all.  Since you didn't even read the OIG page, here is exactly what it says regarding his crimes:

[""**1)** From approximately February 2004 until February 2010, Poul Thorsen executed a scheme to steal grant money awarded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC had awarded grant money to Denmark for research involving infant disabilities, autism, genetic disorders, and fetal alcohol syndrome. CDC awarded the grant to fund studies of the relationship between autism and the exposure to vaccines, the relationship between cerebral palsy and infection during pregnancy, and the relationship between developmental outcomes and fetal alcohol exposure. 
**2)** Thorsen worked as a visiting scientist at CDC, Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, before the grant was awarded. 
**3)**The initial grant was awarded to the Danish Medical Research Council. In approximately 2007, a second grant was awarded to the Danish Agency for Science, Technology, and Innovation. Both agencies are governmental agencies in Denmark. The research was done by the Aarhaus University and Odense University Hospital in Denmark.
**4)** Thorsen allegedly diverted over $1 million of the CDC grant money to his own personal bank account. Thorsen submitted fraudulent invoices on CDC letterhead to medical facilities assisting in the research for reimbursement of work allegedly covered by the grants. The invoices were addressed to Aarhaus University and Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The fact that the invoices were on CDC letterhead made it appear that CDC was requesting the money from Aarhaus University and Sahlgrenska University Hospital although the bank account listed on the invoices belonged to Thorsen.
**5)** **In April 2011, Thorsen was indicted on 22 counts of Wire Fraud and Money Laundering. **
**6)** According to bank account records, Thorsen purchased a home in Atlanta, a Harley Davidson motorcycle, an Audi automobile, and a Honda SUV with funds that he received from the CDC grants. 
**7)** Thorsen is currently in Denmark and is awaiting extradition to the United States.""](https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fugitives/profiles.asp)

As you can see the fraud is financial in nature, not medical or healthcare in nature.  **Again you expose your intellectual dishonesty, Dukey.**  Stomping your feet like the petulant three year old that you are and claiming over and over again that it is a case of medical and healthcare fraud does not make it so.  But I am not bothered in the slightest by educating you over and over again.  It's not a problem because you are an excellent tool to expose not only the lack of scientific understanding and intelligence of the vaccine denial movement but also that it will blatantly lie and twist the facts to suit it's whims. 

>You just read study that fit your viewpoint, and basically reject everything else as junk science or 'anti-vax' propaganda, or some other ridiculous excuse.

I actually read as many of the vaccine studies as I can find.  The ones that support the anti-view are almost always low in population (for example the Wakefield paper had a very low population) and funded by anti-vaccination groups such as the Dwoskin Family Foundation and the Katelyn Fox Foundation.

>If you were so clever at weeding out junk science you would be embarrassed at how the Danish studies were done, and the methodology that was used.

Being clever has nothing to do with it.  It's about having even just a little bit of intelligence - something you sorely lack.  And the Danish studies have been backed up by many other studies, from **reputable** sources.  Previously I provided you a link of dozens of studies from the AAP website.  I assume you are too much of a coward to review them.  Not a problem, this is a public forum in which your ignorance is continually exposed.
