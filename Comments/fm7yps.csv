fl37yjo,"I had a similar experience last week. A friend of mine from college posted a photograph of a notice on his WhatsApp story. The notice was on the letterhead of some religious institution. Not that I have anything against them but the content on the notice was misleading and fake. It was about preventive measures one should take against COVID-19. It mentioned the precautions were from UNICEF and one should follow them religiously. I don't remember most of the points but few of them were - 

1. Refraining from eating ice-cream and other cold foods will prevent the virus from spreading.
2. Drinking warm water regularly will kill the virus.
3. The virus will not survive for more than 12 hours in hot weather like ours and hence one must come out in the day when the sun is out. 
4. Do some breathing exercises and it will force the virus out of your throat and subsequently it will be excreted from the body.

I was taken aback when I read it. Now this friend of mine is an engineer and is studying for UPSC. He is also quite active religiously. I don't have anything against it but I was quite surprised to see something like that from an educated person. I immediately messaged him with the [link](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/statement-charlotte-petri-gornitzka-unicef-deputy-executive-director-partnerships) to UNICEF's statement regarding the spread of such rumours. It's quite surprising to see educated people spread such fake messages. It didn't just stop there. I was expecting him to change his story after I informed him but he didn't even bother to do so.

You need to give example but issue is this type of arguments are themselves weak in nature but honestly its how even we young people argue. Factual argument need at least one side who have enough facts to prove that his/her argument is trustable. Human nature is like that we sometime believe idiotic stuff and we stick to it cuz over time our brain looses its plasticity (adaptivity). So be careful with them when approaching you know they aren't young enough to adapt to change. It just parents and adults mostly compare their young version to you and overtime our brain slowly looses some memories and replace those with fake ones perfect one. So unkill bragging about how perfect kid was he is common. So human nature i was better kid than you cuz i never said something like that in front of my uncle so you are bad kid.

It matters because the post that this comment lies in talks about, rather idiotically I might add, that a 12 hour lockdown will fully get rid of residual viruses. It won't. Even on copper, which is known for its anti microbial properties just a group of 10 viruses will survive for more than 12 hours.

fl47273,">Dude these are well accepted terms in political science.

Not Indian political science they are not. 

>Though their definition is often contested there is an academic consensus on a great many parts of these ideologies.

Is it? Because I certainly haven't ever seen these terms used outside ridiculously oversimplified articles about Indian politics written for an international audience that neither understands nor cares for nuance.

Do you know what ""left wing"" and ""right wing"" are called in any Indian language? Because I certainly have never seen those terms translated for native Indian audience.

And if we're defining ourselves by lines of political ideology that don't even translate for the average Indian voter, then that's just empty academic sticking points. 

You think the average Indian voter even a well informed one knows or cares whether he's voting for the ""right wing"" or the ""left wing?""

And like I said, who gets to decide where to draw the line? BJP appeases Hindus. Congress has historically appeased Muslims. Shah Bano case anyone?

So how do you decide which one of these is ""more"" right wing than the other? Because both look socially right wing from where I am standing.

And that's the other danger of aping Western binary classifications. The rest of the world, which doesn't know better, is automatically going to assume that the Indian right and the Western right are corollaries. And that the Western left and the Indian left are corollaries.

They're not. The Congress isn't the Democrats, the BJPis not the Republicans, Modi isn't Trump, Sonia Gandhi is not Hillary Clinton, Rahul Gandhi is not Justin Trudeau.

Yes, they are. And for the third time, nobody gave you authority to make blanket assertions about who does or does not qualify as ""left wing"" or ""right wing.""

fl4dvd6,"> Because I certainly have never seen those terms translated for native Indian audience

Growing up in Kerala, I have read news articles frequently use phrases like ""ഇടതു പക്ഷം"" when referring to the left wing, or ""വലതു പക്ഷം"" referring to right wing politics. Using the terms don't mean ""aping the west"". This goes back to the early 2000s and late 90s at least as long as I could read or listen to Doordarshan news on TV. 

IMO Congress has been mostly centre-right in their political ideologies and this too varies from region to region. The CPI in India has had some very bad policies in their time in power but surely you can see how they are more ""left"" from a fiscal perspective and a social perspective compared to the BJP. Especially when it comes to things like caste inequality and uplifting of people out of poverty (while yes I acknowledge there has been corruption scandals in both these cases to the detriment of the poor). 

For example, NDA's last reign saw significant divestment of public enterprises into private hands, significant tax cuts for corporations etc. Bad loans given to very rich individuals/companies from nationalized banks and then having them written off. And under Modi, there are more socially conservative policies if I am not wrong. 

There is in some cases, toxic nationalism that claims Indian and/or Hindu culture is superior to everything else, demands of blind devotion at risk of being labeled ""anti-national"". These are the hallmarks of extreme right-wing ideology IMO. You don't see the more ""left"" political entities in India do that. 

> They're not. The Congress isn't the Democrats, the BJPis not the Republicans, Modi isn't Trump, Sonia Gandhi is not Hillary Clinton, Rahul Gandhi is not Justin Trudeau.

It doesn't have to mean that to refer to left wing and right wing politics in *a particular country*. On a spectrum of policies specific to India, surely you can see how BJP is further to the right than Congress or the LDF and the RSS even more so. 

""Left wing"" in the United States is hardly left wing at all compared to left parties in the EU or the CPI in India. Same with the liberal party in Canada or the Labor party in the UK. It is region specific. But it is perfectly valid to use labels like left-wing and right-wing with regards to the policies when comparing political parties of a specific region.
