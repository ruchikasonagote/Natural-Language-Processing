Translation with story:

PM Modi was answering questions from students across the nation on the occasion of Teachers Day (celebrated on 15 Sep every year in India). A question was raised by a student regarding climate change and its threat to the planet today. 

Question: We in Assam (a state in India)  feel very concerned about climate change and its consequences. Sir, how can you help and guide us to protect our pristine environment?

PM Modi's response: See how these day even small kids are discussing about climate change and environmental change! In villages especially in winter, you'll see old people aged 70, 80 85 or 90, say that its colder this year than ever before. Don't they say such things? Actually its not any colder. Their capacity to tolerate cold has reduced due to their aging. In the same manner, the climate hasn't changed. We have changed!

PM Modi also decided to skip the UN Climate Change Summit on Sep 23rd along with the Chinese Premier. India & China together represent the largest polluting countries on the planet.

On being questioned finally Environment Minister, Prakash Javadekar, explained that ""the prime minister just has a ""dramatic"" way of warning people against an unsustainable lifestyle""

However, PM Modi decided to skip the UN Climate Change Summit on Sep 23rd, the same year, along with the Chinese Premier. India & China together represent the largest polluting countries on the planet.


Finally, on his foreign visits over the past year, PM Narendra Modi has flagged terrorism and climate change as the gravest problems in the world. And in the run up to the climate change summit in Paris, he has set himself up as an influential voice on the global crisis. So some sense seems to have been knocked into him and we see India on the fight against climate change - which is commendable.

Having said this I also have to add:



Country | CO2 emissions (kt) in 2015 | Emission per capita (t) in 2015
---|---|----
China | 10,641,789 | 7.7
United States | 5,172,338 | 16.1
European Union | 3,469,671 | 6.9
India | 2,454,968 | 1.9

Or are you saying Indians don't have the basic human right to develop their country?

First and foremost, I cannot and will not accept any type of guilt for something I have not personally done. Fuck that. You're going to have to get in line behind Blacks, Jews, Native Americans, etc, etc if you want guilt payments.

Second, plenty of technology has been developed over the last 100 years. Those fossil fuels weren't wasted, we have things now that didn't exist then.

Third, wealth redistribution would help you in the short term, but long term all it would do is destroy both of our countries. What India needs (in my opinion, not an expert) is a change in culture.

dievmbw,"Completely absurd.

India and China aren't voluntarily slowing down any growth. They are growing as fast as they possibly can, and they are increasing their emissions to do so. They have simply agreed to take money from other nations to derive some of the extra required energy from greener sources. If they weren't being paid and gifted the technology to do it, then it wouldn't be happening. You would know this if you actually read their pledge as part of the Paris agreement. They will need vast amounts of international funding to even come close to reaching their goals.

Notice the difference in the statistics you quoted. India and China have agreed to reduce their ""emission intensity"", which correlates to GDP and not actual emission levels. So basically, they are going to grow their economies faster than their emission levels grow, which is not a pledge to do anything at all. That is a natural side effect of rapidly growing an economy. So by 2030, they will be polluting at a much higher level than they do now. Meanwhile, the United States was expected to cut **actual emissions** by 25-28%. So the United States is expected to shrink their economy, cut emissions, and pay other countries, while India is expected to **increase** their emissions, experience significant economic growth, and get paid to do it.

And you want to talk about actual air pollution that is harmful to human health? India's air quality is staggeringly bad compared to the United States. Producing goods in the United States is absolutely safer for the environment and the people that live there compared to India, and it's not even close.

Singhal, head of dairy cattle nutrition at the National Dairy Research Institute in Karnal in northern India, says, ""while livestock plays a crucial role in the economy, global warming is becoming a huge worry. We're trying to find indigenous solutions, because our realities are very different from the West.""

> ""For starters, most Indian livestock is underfed and undernourished, unlike its robust counterparts in richer countries. The typical Indian farmer is unable to buy expensive dietary supplements even for livestock of productive age, and dry milch cattle and older farm animals are invariably turned out to fend for themselves. Poor-quality feed equals poor animal health as well as higher methane production. 
> 
> Also, even when Western firms are willing to share technology or when Western products are available, these options are often unaffordable for the majority in India. For instance, Monensin, an antibiotic whose slow-release formula reduces methane emission by cows, proved too expensive for widespread use in India. 
> 
> So the emphasis for Indian scientists is on indigenous solutions. ""We know we cannot count on high-quality feed and fodder,"" says Singhal. ""No one will be able to afford it. What we have done instead is develop cheaper technologies and products."" One example is urea-molasses-mineral blocks that are cheap, reduce methane emission by 20%, and also provide more nutrition, so they're easier to sell to illiterate farmers who don't know a thing about global warming but want higher milk yields.""

Food & Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations Organization says in its Key facts and findings:

> Total emissions from global livestock: 7.1 Gigatonnes of Co2-equiv per year, representing 14.5 percent of all anthropogenic GHG emissions. 

So this should be easy to calculate how much each country individually emits wrt to its cattle population.

>On a commodity-basis, beef and cattle milk are responsible for the most emissions, respectively, contributing 41 percent and 20 percent of the sector’s overall GHG outputs. 

India ranks as fifth in beef consumption and is the largest milk producer in the world by a huge margin. So that's a huge contribution to the emissions too.

To answer your question, it doesn't look like GHG emissions statistics for countries take into account that of cattle.

Although United Nations report, Livestock's Long Shadow, has identified the world's rapidly growing herds of cattle as the greatest threat to the climate, forests and wildlife. And they are blamed for a host of other environmental crimes, from acid rain to the introduction of alien species, from producing deserts to creating dead zones in the oceans, from poisoning rivers and drinking water to destroying coral reefs. and lays the blame squarely on the world's 1.5 billion cattle! Livestock are responsible for 18 per cent of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming, more than cars, planes and all other forms of transport put together.

Tl;dr US filed a complaint at the WTO because the Indian govt was subsidizing domestic production of solar panels to accelerate growth of clean energy. Their argument was that this is not fair for the manufacturers in the US since the domestic solar panels are now cheaper than the international market.

Essentially, **US sued a third world country for trying to make solar panels cheaper and therefore more accessible**, because the US manufacturers were unable to match those prices, and the WTO ruled in favor of the US manufacturers.

Before you go into how this may or may not be fair according to the terms of the WTO - the US actively prevented another country from shifting to solar faster, and you think that exiting the Paris deal is okay because 'exiting does not mean we won't stop polluting'.

At this rate India’s per capita emissions of greenhouse gas would still remain below the existing global average, the energy and climate experts of the government estimated at 4.14 tonnes of carbon per capita.

Yes, that is actual emission tied to 2005 GDP. Absolute reductions are untenable in an economy that is really really poor. As long as coal and petroleum products are cheap and easy to generate power from, they will be the primary sources. There is a concerted push made away from this but it is humanly impossible to go 100% green with no impact on a few hundred million people, to the extent where their lives are at jeopardy.

Stop glorifying Indians as paragons of scientific virtue, you remember the last science congress? Science denial is not a small minority here as you are making it seem. It is big and the only reason it is not as dangerous internationally is because they are focused on destroying our internal scientific institutions.

We have a government that recognizes degrees in homeopathy and astrology. The way the country is going, as the rural population onboards the internet, you'll realize how stupid we really are. I am saying just to tell you to get off your high worse - religion based anti-intellectualism is huge in India. It hasn't severely affected our power and geopolitics much - but we are afflicted by it - Muslim communities in north India are full of anti-vaccers who think Polio vaccines are an attempt to sterilize them, there is a significant chunk of religiously motivated people who have been making sure millions of children grow up stunted by removing all animal protein sources including eggs from government food distribution programs - and our supposedly secular government has been pandering to those motherfuckers for years. 

These hundred million kids growing malnourished will have global consequences - have no doubt of that. We have protests against GMOs and Nuclear power plants every other month, and part of the reason solar is taking off is because the Indian SJWs haven't started protesting against it (yet). Part of the reason Norman Borlaug succeeded was because our population wasn't 'enlightened' enough to follow the organic farming fad yet.

About population growth - the world as a whole has already hit 'peak Child', which is, the number of children being born year over year has stabiliized/started decreasing. The 'problem' is 'solved'. The only reason the population is increasing is because people are living longer. Unless you want to bring the growth rate down to 0 by killing old people, acknowledge that we've reached 'peak child', the growth rate will naturally gravitate downwards to 0 over time, and move on to focus on how we can engineer a planet than can handle the extra people.

Current projections state that the world's population will cap out at 9 billion within the next century before falling. There is nothing more that can be done about this 9 billion number without going and actively murdering people. 

Assuming no technological innovation at all in agritech, using existing methods developed by Norman Borlaug - we can support 10 billion people in terms of food. So we aren't going to die hungry provided we are able to deliver this food efficiently.

The only thing left is energy and efficiency, which can enable a good quality of life to everyone - and with the cost of solar power plummeting below coal (artificially right now, but in a sustainable way in the next few years) the climate problem is entirely solvable using renewable techniques,  - the only difference is that we need to build energy infrastructure which is not reliant on fossil fuel and can handle 1.5x the population.

The reason why those poor Indians and chinese are able to take your jobs away is because they've got a government that with their limited resources tries to provide it's citizens an equal platform to grow. So the poor Pajeet and Ying Chang have got almost free education and healthcare as safety net.

You know the germans or dutch are not crying of job going away, they're not trying to open up coal mines, rather are investing heavily in solar and wind. That is because the government has ensured that no one gets left behind. Everyone attains some form of formal education and skill. Nobody dies because of not being able to afford healthcare.

It's time Americans ask their money to be used on themselves. It's time american soldiers question why they are being posted to faraway areas just to topple governments and protect their countries oil interest in the name of patriotism. Usually one expects a first world country government to be less corrupt and people being more open to what's happening around them. But in case of america, your politicians are hand in gloves with the lobbies, saudi arabs, and now russians and your people are closed to any idea around free education and healthcare when your government can actually afford that.

EDIT: If your government says that's fiscally not possible then you should seriously wonder what the ""richest country"" tag means. And if that's too much to expect out of your government then you should also think whether you really deserve the tag of ""most powerful nation""",5,5,1496537558.0,bhen_ka_lauda,1496537925.0,negative,negative,negative,negative

If nothing, the pullout has definitely increased activity on a personal level. It remains to be seen if a few private companies are able to gather enough resources to match what the entire nation could have done had it remained in the deal. And cmon, these organizations were not going to sit around on their asses had the US stayed. But yes, it certainly has increased interest and debate.

>how would the Paris agreement decrease its emissions and how effective would this be in combating global carbon emissions? 

Are you saying, that since the decrease is not guaranteed, let's not try at all?

>Also, to your India point, a large percentage lives in rural areas but urbanization growth is increasing, same in China.

I agree. That is kind of my point. Till 70 years back, India was colonized and had no chance to develop infrastructure, industries, jobs, etc. Which is definitely why India per capita emissions will be lower, and which is why India's stance is that already developed countries (which have emitted a huge portion of greenhouse gases already) have the moral obligation to support other economies so that they don't do the same.
Additionally, it is not just India and the US. Europe is well developed, right? And there are no absurd population anomalies there, so per capita data should be comparable, right? France has one-third of the per capita emissions. Germany has just over half. The UK has less than half.

Here is more context for you:  
  
> The U.S., for instance, set a target of reducing its emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below its 2005 level by 2025. That’s an absolute reduction. China, meanwhile, set a target that’s a ratio of gross domestic product, which means its total emissions will continue to increase as the country develops. China says it will lower its emissions per unit of gross domestic product within the range of 60 percent to 65 percent below the 2005 level by 2030. And the country set a goal of peaking its carbon dioxide emissions around 2030, with “best efforts to peak early.”
> All 195 countries that signed on to the agreement were asked to submit “nationally determined contributions,” which are voluntary targets for how they will contribute to achieving the agreement’s primary goal — to keep global average temperature “well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.”
> India, too, has pledged an emissions reduction per unit of GDP, not an absolute reduction. Its target is for emissions per unit of GDP to be within the range of 33 percent to 35 percent below the 2005 level in 2030.
> Since China’s and India’s targets allow emissions to increase until 2030, while the U.S. has set absolute reduction targets, we’ve heard misleading claims that those two developing countries don’t have to do anything until 2030. But as we’ve explained, they do have to take steps to meet those 2030 goals, and both countries have said they’ll increase their share of non-fossil fuel energy.

To break it down for your simple brain  
 
US said they would voluntarily absolutely reduce emissions by 26-28% below its 2005 level by 2025.  
India and China have said they too will reduce emissions, but as a fraction of their GDP. China says they'll reduce emissions **per unit of GDP** by 60-65% of their 2005 GDP by 2030, and India says it will do the same by 33-35% **per unit of GDP** by 2030.  
  
No matter how you spin it, the Indian population is giant and the Indian/Chinese GDP are unlikely to catch up with overall American GDP.  
  
Instead of having uncontrolled, destructive growth like the Americans, India and China have slowed down quite dramatically - so what more do you expect? For all growth to come from renewable sources?

>Are you saying, that since the decrease is not guaranteed, let's not try at all?

Of course not, only that we should try something else.

>I agree. That is kind of my point. Till 70 years back, India was colonized and had no chance to develop infrastructure, industries, jobs, etc. Which is definitely why India per capita emissions will be lower, and which is why India's stance is that already developed countries (which have emitted a huge portion of greenhouse gases already) have the moral obligation to support other economies so that they don't do the same.

I'm sorry but that's flat out wrong. Large portions of India's infrastructure was built by the [British](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rail_transport_in_India). Also, jobs were plentiful, just not in a industrial capacity. True, colonialism suppressed India's industrial growth, I cannot argue against that but you also cannot argue with the same logic that developed nations have moral obligation to pay for their ""crime"" when it was unknown at that time the effects of industrialization and that without it, growth and overall standard of living would have been severely impacted. I agree that we should be held responsible for the CO2 emissions we emit today, but saying that the less populated, less urbanized, less industrial past is comparable to today is absurd, even if you argue its accumulative effect.


>Additionally, it is not just India and the US. Europe is well developed, right? And there are no absurd population anomalies there, so per capita data should be comparable, right? France has one-third of the per capita emissions. Germany has just over half. The UK has less than half.

True, railways were seen as a way to efficiently move goods from the interior to the ports so that the Brits could sell them, and I agree they did make a lot of them :) 

> moral obligation to pay for their ""crime"" 

The development of a country and its infrastructure always come at the cost of more emissions. I don't think it is a punishment for committing a crime (one they did not even realize at that point), but rather acknowledging that all countries have the right to develop, and just because some developed before we realized that CO2 emissions are bad should not deny that chance to other countries. So in that sense I feel India has a right to demand more from the other developed countries, so that we are able to make roads, move our people out of poverty and hunger, issues that have already been tackled in the west.

You can start whining about India's overpopulation when we start polluting more than the US in absolute terms.

Firstly, yours is a circular argument. Did liberalism develop because of institutional advancements in Europe or the other way round. But let's leave that aside. If you read the philosophy of liberalism without bias, you'll see how liberal thinkers put themselves on a pedestal, they created a hierarchy in which societies governed by liberal values were treated as inherently superior. Liberalism also had its own version of missionary zeal. All this created the conditions for racist expansionism. 

That is why I compared it to jihad. 

As for enlightenment values, what was the French Revolution if not an expansionist 'holy' war?

> I think that the vast majority of the worlds cultural groups at the time (or any time before) would have made similar actions should they have received similar capabilities.

But they did not. When European piracy wreaked havoc on the world's oceans, the most prominent cultural groups in Asia were moving towards their own, indigenous political orders. China, for example, till the early 19th century had more capability than all of Europe put together. They didn't convert their capabilities into banditry. There is a lot of conjecture in your argument. 

> While for a large period of time Europe certainly made life shittier (and in many cases much much shittier) in many places across the world, the world as it currently stands is at an all time low in how shitty life is because of the advances of westernized nations.

This is pretty ridiculous. European colonialism killed millions of people, committed genocide, extinguished cultures, held humanity's development back for two centuries. Even after they were thrown out of conquered lands, after their short lived hegemony, there has been no transfer of wealth that comes even close to a portion of wealth that was looted. 

That might be the conqueror's prerogative - to hold on to wealth they have looted. But their crimes cannot be extinguished or forgiven. 

How can you even say that the West has made life better for people in the world when it is responsible for making it as pathetic as it was in the first place?

There have been different epochs of globalisation and in each one civilisation or another has contributed something to its evolution. Human history has to be seen as a collective - the arbitrary division of West and East is just that, a political invention. And much more recent than Euro-supremacists would like. 

> Nothing before reached anywhere close to this scale of economic integration, and all of this kind of trade works on ideas that are or evolved out of western models of companies etc.

Again, you're giving the West credit for everything on the basis of some things. The Age of Exploration has been exalted as an age of European supremacy. But almost everything from ship building to navigation was derived from the Arabs. [Even things like double entry book keeping were inspired by Arab methods and had been developed independently in Korea before Europe.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system). 

Please be sure, every phase of globalisation is a collaborative global scale process. You cannot exalt one side of the 'globe' just because you happen to live there. The trade that funded the wealth of the West, was with the  East, wasn't it? So how can you remove one side of the equation?

There is conjecture and there is fact. Hypothetically you are right. But history says it was one 'civilisation' that brought destruction on a global scale, and it was the West. Historically, the Age of European Imperialism can only be compared to the Mongol Empire - but in consequence it dwarfs that too. 

Re the French Revolution, I'm referring to the Reign of Terror. The FR was founded on enlightenment ideals. That didn't prevent the bloodbath. It shows the enlightenment ideals were not as noble as you claim. 

> China had a large population and economy, but it was a stagnant empire uninterested in enlightenment ideas and technological advancement.

Perhaps the Chinese Emperor was a fool. You cannot judge an entire people based on the attitudes of their ruler. Or, what should we make of the 'free world' today, considering the nature of its leader? The idea that the Chinese Empire was stagnant is nothing but a lazy trope. Even if it was, it's no excuse for how the Chinese people were treated by the West, beginning with Britain pushing the opium trade.

I'll give you an analogy. What if you were kidnapped and kept in a basement. After a lifetime there, can your kidnapper claim credit for coming down into basement everyday and feeding you?

I find your attitude shockingly callous. After admitting that Western Imperialism ruined entire civilisations, continued this over almost a century and a half, you claim 'we' should be grateful for the 'advancement' we were given! Shocking. 

In the entire generations that were ruined, you don't think hundreds of thousands of great minds were lost too? Did the Europeans provide anywhere close to the education facilities, healthcare, law and order in the 'colonies' as they did at home? No! Their colonial loot provided for comforts at home. 

They hypocritically neglected the duties of the state their own liberal philosophers spoke of so exaltingly. 

The last two centuries would have seen exponentially more advancement but for a civilisation of bandits and thieves who devastated cultures, slaughtered millions wherever they went. 

> If you honestly think life now is not vastly better than it was in 1600 you're deluded. The last few hundred years are the first time in history that there exist societies where the lives of the masses are not complete an utter shit.

Sorry, bro, that utopia is still not here. Even in the mid 20th century, when colonialism ended, the life of the masses was shit. In fact, before departing India, the great noble British race engineered a famine in India killing millions. Any progress that has been made, has come since then. We were left in ruins, hungry, poor, left in a state of civil war. That was the utterest shit.

Credit to Norman Boulrag but he would chafe at your words. I have read his interviews, he would never fail to mention the tenacity and resolve of the small farmers he worked with, who toiled day and night to grow the crops which fed the world. Of course, you would give them no credit. You have shown yourself to be callous to suffering again and again. 

You would also perhaps not know how Boulrag's Indian scientist colleagues, MS Swaminathan and Subramanian, worked with him. He never failed to credit them too. 

I admire the West - despite the artificiality of the term - for a lot. Not the least for people like Boulrag, and hundreds of thousands like him. The West gave the world a lot, not in the least, the techniques of the scientific method. The Scientific Method was a philosophy born in the West, much like Buddhism in India or Confucianism in China. But the leaders of the West used it selfishly, to gain power and wealth. This western philosophy could have spread to the world without colonialism. Human civilisation as a whole would have tremendously benefitted. 

But by using science for conquest, the West did a great disservice to humanity. We cannot make up for the lost generations. ",1,4,1496650148.0,,1496650355.0,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

diiszmv,"Globalization was a term created quite recently to describe the increasing economic integration and exchange occurring across the globe. People then realized that the term could be extended slightly to describe earlier occurrences of exchange. However if you don't acknowledge that the modern phenomenon is a totally different kind of animal than what had occurred before I can't help you. 

As to you talking about the physical aspects of trade that isn't what I was referring too (BTW the astrolabe was invented by Apollonius of Perga, Greek, before going to the Islamic world and being improved, before being more significantly changed and improved into the mariners astrolabe in Spain). I was talking about modern companies etc. as they exist in the common European derived formulation. 

As to exhaling it I exalt the culture who created the innovations it spread and did the spreading. I don't know how much it counts as a hypothetical when time after time the culture with the superior ability to fight and conquer does just that. 

Revolutions are often bloody and I never said enlightenment philosophy was perfect. Also I was confused by you calling it expansionist. While I can kinda see the idea behind calling it expansionist I don't know if I'd call any revolution (with the exception of strongly foreign supported ones, e.g. USSR and USA in the cold war) expansionist. 

As to the Chinese emperor its not like he was the only one shown it, the innovations were presented to the court. It was a pervasive attitude to the point that giving mechanical clocks to the Chinese emperors became a thing. 

I'd compare it to kicking over a homeless man's shack and stealing his stuff for a while. Then you give him a job (I'll admit its generally probably a shitty one/talking about industrialization). Setup a bank account for them (trade infrastructure). And an several informational manuals about skills etc. (technology). Also I never said you should be grateful. I think that you should acknowledge the incredible power of enlightenment philosophy for creating technological and economic advancement. I want every country to have a story like Japan.

Never said utopia was here, just that before western philosophy the only civilizations that existed were ones where the vast vast majority of their population existed in the most abject of poverty. That is no longer true. 

For research as I said vastly more advancement has happened recently than had happened in all of human history prior. Western philosophy was the catalyst for scientific advancement.

The doubling is what I was talking about, not the initial capacity that existed. Though I suppose I should give credit to the farmers, accepting the advancement so quickly is hardly something I'd expect in general. 

I never mentioned any of Boulrag's other colleagues either. 

Yeah it did, and you're right. But frankly I don't see recognizing how powerful western philosophy is to be compatible with stating ""'Advance' and 'Westernize' - lol.""
