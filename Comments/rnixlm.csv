So middle class professionals in India earn more relative to the cost of living when compared to what they will earn overseas.

House help in India is one of the better blue collar professions when compared to landless farming, factory work or mining (your only options if you are poor and landless).

It's not like going overseas frees your house help of a demeaning job they will just have to find a different employer.

Also it's not like you can't have house help in the West, here in the UK we keep a maid as well, she's white and used to come every fortnight for 3 hours.

All this lady is saying effectively is that she earns more relative to living costs in India so prefers to stay there, that's all.

To each their own I guess.

Here in the UK I clean my bathroom, wash dishes and help my parents cook. I had to learn all these things and I did even though it was difficult at first. We didn't always have a maid here and even when we did she didn't come that often.

Maid would barely clean up. Went through 4 sets of glasses, teacups in 5 years. Many other dishes damaged. 
Grocery stores open from 6 am till 2 in the night cang get fresh vegetables any time I needed. 

Had kept a extra stand up freezer in US. 

Get clean veggies in US . Meat in bulk . Hardly any dust vaccum twice a week( Indians skimp on both vaccuming and buying good vaccums)

Had Roomba for vaccuming too. 

No water problem in US. Hardwater and constant  plumbing problems in India . Can't drink tap water in India

Stream of cooks. One was timely but not s grat cook
 ,One was good cook but was seperated from husband and living with a guy who had abandoned his wife, he was super jelous wouldn't let her have a mobile phone. Endless drama. Neither of them would agree to Cook non veg but all ate at nonveg at home. Got a Cook who was a decent Cook but she was routinely late and will of occassionaly get her teen daughter ti assist her ,her other daughter would come to chat sometimes her bhabi would drop in , kids would keep asking  mother to stop work and go home in 20 minutes of her coming to work and will of throw tantrums Endless drama we felt we gained a new set of relatives, drama company all paid by us.   Cook used to use 8 liters of oil a month , needed supervision constantly which defeated the purpose of having a cook. Then came COVID . Paid her 8 months full salary without asking  her come now we manage on our own . Peace
 

In US we could buy in bulk. Make fried brown onion 20 kg put in freezer in small ziplock bags. Make gravvies enough for 10-20 times divide in boxes and keep, make palak in bulk di the same, Saute onion in bulk and keep in small ziplock bags. Make mutton chicken , kheema in 4-7 kg at a time and make 8 servings portions and keep in freezer. Get frozen samosa, chappati, tandoori roti, snacks etc , puff pastry sheets. 
Dish washer, excellent washing machine,  dryer so many convinienceses  

Excellent products to keep kitchen , bath room clean unlike useless products available here. 

Hell life is much more easier I used to get better Indian groceries there.dont get Kari patta in Chandigarh, scarce in Gurgaon especially winter, get gongura even in Indiana can't get it in NCR . Hell I get frozen tamarind shoots in Vietnamese shops can't get it 90% of Indian cities.

hpw72u5,"It's not always about if ""You can"", but about if ""You want to do something"".

Not being able to do something, or lacking the skills is a survival failure. Many people just couldn't work at all during the pandemic, because their maid stopped coming to work, and they had no clue how to do anything.

But still, not doing it yourself when you have options, can be a choice. In fact, a smart one.

I personally love cooking, but I feel that my time is better spent focusing on things that bring me value. My job, my side hustle, my learning, spending time with family. Same applies to my wife.

Or it can even be something that is part of ""giving back"", ie spending weekly time with students/professionals whom I am mentoring.

Even when we had to, we chose to meal prep in bulk, to save time. I used to do the dishes while listening to books. My wife decided to move TV to kitchen, to complete cooking and catching up on TV shows passively.

It makes sense to pass on my daily chores to someone else, minus exploitation. I have seen poverty myself, so I understand that getting a decent job is a difficult task, when most people basically want to get all their daily chores done almost for free. (or for less than 50% of their monthly Swiggy expenses)

Even if you pay your house-helps decently, give them decent holidays, and don't make them kill their relatives to get even a single day off. Always make sure that you give them a deal and work atmosphere that you would like to work in.

I have no clue what our Desis are doing offshore, but I see entitled AHs in my society shouting on their househelp, for things like-

""Mygate app shows that you had entered the society 15 minutes ago? Why did you reach my house so late? What do you mean you were having breakfast in the garden? How can you eat yourself before making our food? Am I paying you to have food here?""

The fact that I just can't slap such AH, makes me feel how helpless that worker must be feeling.

And it makes sense, if you treat someone well, they treat you well. Paying a little extra, or paying for your maid's child's education sometimes won't really make you poor. But if you take care of them, in return, they do the same. And you can see that difference in how they work at your home.

hpwtd3c,"Yes, it IS a societal issue. But the least one can do, is not to exploit someone themselves. A house help genuinely adds a lot more value to your life, than what you pay them. So it wouldn't hurt to pay a bit more to them.

Size of a Swiggy order easily crosses Rs. 500. And still people negotiate to pay 500 less to their maid.

What you can do about rest of the world, might be limited. I have had people come to fight with me complaining that I am paying my maid extra, so now she is asking them to increase pay as well.

They went on to rant how I am spoiling them, and that in a way I am insulting others, who can't afford to pay more to servants. This asshole is in upper management of a product based company. His tale home would be north of 50 lacs. If he can't afford to pay her house help 500 extra, I don't know when he will finally be earning enough.

I asked him to fuck off, but then had to ask my maid not to go around and tell everyone that I am paying her more than ""market rate"", else these people will keep coming to eat my head.

I certainly am not in the condition to fight an all out war with everyone in my society, and to force them pay more. Anyways, the legal minimum in India is too low, that I can't expect any help from police. (It's Rs 170/day if I remember correctly, which is 21-22/hour)

I have even seen people complaining here, how these maids are looting us, by charging so high.

So even though what you said, is true. It's kind of part of the problem, if you just stop with ""world is fucked up"", and don't atleast take a step in your own personal capacity.",1,3,1640435437.0,ok_i_am_that_guy,False,neutral,neutral,positive,neutral

hpw9qfr,"No, that's really fucked up way to think. Thinking that your existence itself is a sin, and it's the system that's fucked up, is best way to discount yourself out of doing anything, and still feel good about yourself.

Even in a capitalist system, you always have a choice. People can still be decent people, regardless of being inherently selfish.

The problem is that people don't understand the value that they get out of anything, except the value that comes in form of money or labour.

I have seen people shouting on their maids in the lines of - ""We are paying you for 1 hour, how dare you spend 10 minutes less?"", or running behind the maid all the time, shouting at them to clean each and every corner of the house, just because - ""If we are paying them, everything must be done perfectly"". Some just have an OCD, that they want their worker to take the burden of.

Such people, apart from being toxic employers, are also in a pathetic mental state themselves. They don't understand the value of their own time. They spend time on trivial nitpicking, that they could rather spend on their job, business, children's education, family, etc.

One of my aunt, who is from a really rich family, gets panic attack dealing with her maids. She sometimes has to lie down panting, after shouting for an hour on servants, for really trivial things. One of my fears is that she is going to leave this world someday, while being in such distress, during one of these episodes.

If you are doing this, you don't even understand capitalism. Your capital is not only your money, but also your time, energy and mental peace. And if you are spending it running behind your house-helps, making their life miserable as well, then you should rather do all the work yourself.

If you instead avoid hard negotiating with your house-help for salary, till the point that they reluctantly take up your job. And just pay them Rs. 500-1000 extra, if they happen to ask for less, maybe they will not try so hard to scam you all the time, by skipping work.

Socialism/communism could be great, I can certainly get behind that. But you can see how human greed has fucked it up as well, in communist countries as well, where people are oppressed even more, and don't get the much liberty to complain as well.

For either communism or capitalism to work well for everyone, we first need to be better people. Both sound better in motivational speeches, but human greed and inequality of demand & supply of labour, can turn both of them into a shit-show.

And yeah, blessings...
Don't forget blessings. They somehow work as well. Might sound funny, but I always tell my maid that I will give her minimum 10% salary hike every year, and if I happen to get a bigger hike in my job, then the same amount. After I explained her how percentage works, she was quite happy with the numbers. During my last appraisal, she told me that she went to a temple, and prayed that I get a 30% hike. I thanked her, and didn't think much of it. Most probably a correlation, but I got exactly 30. (at best I was expecting a 15), which I passed on to her as well, as promised.

So yeah, you can fucking flourish, and can still be a decent enough person. Just make the right choices whenever you can.",2,3,1640416991.0,ok_i_am_that_guy,False,negative,negative,negative,negative
hpway47,"And that's just sad. Minimum wage in US is $7.25/hour, which is PPP equivalent of Rs.36,540/pm(7.25*8*(PPP of 21)*30)

Which isn't too much, knowing that for 1-2 hours of work, she essentially needs to pay less than Rs. 4.5k-9k/month. (which btw, is kind of a regular rate in cities like Bangalore)

But yes, we Indians do have a nature to exploit. Even I earned much less than that in India, when I started working my first software job. (even that had still put me into top 7% band of salaries compared to rest of the country). The problem is that our companies/their investors expect to get their workforce expenses covered with the smallest possible part of the expenses, and employees try to cover their house help expense sorted in a much smaller part of their expenses as well.

The problem is that most of the people going to USA, were making a much lesser money in India. And even as they are now earning in dollars, they feel shame in paying their servants salaries closer to what they themselves used to make few years ago, and try to find a servant within the money range they paid back here.

Also, somehow many of them don't intuitively understand PPP, or they might have reconsidered their decision to work abroad. That makes them multiply all the money that they pay with 75, which seems to drive their urge to pay too low even further.",1,3,1640418042.0,ok_i_am_that_guy,1640418244.0,negative,negative,negative,negative
hqdpzjr,"We should look at it in terms of PPP of 15 Canadian $. That comes around 21.99/1.26 = 17.45 . So, PPP equivalent of C$ 15 /hr, for a month, would be:

(17.45)*15*30 = 7853 INR.

This actually very close to what people pay in Indian cities like Bangalore, Mumbai as well, to their domestic helpers, who work for under an hour daily.

The only difference being that this rate is for 3-5 membered families. For bachelors, it's much lower, as the amount of work (# of utensils to wash) is reduced as well, and so does the time being spent. Some people here try to fill as much work as they can, in that one hour, just for the sake of ""getting everything done"", which sucks.

The problem is that a lot of people looking for on-site roles, don't look at the PPP equivalent of money that they would be making. (if they did, many would reconsider going there in the first place), they tell their friends and family, how they are making 45-60 lacs, or even 1-2 crores a year in USA.

While, PPP equivalent of $60k pa is not 45 lacs, but 13.2 LPA (at least for the amount that they have to spend there, savings can be considered around exchange rate) A seemingly 1 crore+ offer in USA (> $150k), is just 30 lacs in terms of PPP.

So if someone is going with expectations of 1 Crore+ salary, and considering themselves entitled to things that they can buy here, with that money, or even with a plan of just spending what they spent here, and saving rest of it, they are going to be shocked as for them the above calculation of a maid's salary would seem like 30-40k a month.

When they see the obvious gap i their expectations and reality, they either cry about how costly everything is, or they try to maintain their privileges without paying for it (aka. exploiting the weak)

Sadly, these are the people, who shame us globally, and are bad for both India and the country that they live in. And then we complain that anger of the natives towards such behavior is racism.",2,3,1640759259.0,ok_i_am_that_guy,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

I see such logic within the lines of some religious rhetorics like -""But all people must accept Christ as their saviour"", ""But all other religions are inherently evil, if they don't walk the path shown by our prophet"", ""Casteism can't be wrong, because god must have had a plan, when putting someone in a lower, while someone else in a higher caste""

These arguments cannot be considered as a ""source of truth"", to base further arguments on. These themselves are either assumptions, or rhetoric statements.

If you believe that any value is created by labour, and so labourers should own that, you are extremely oversimplifying what all goes into producing anything(product or service), before labor is even needed.

Research, capital, risk, vision, and a lot of other tangible or intangible forms of labour and risk are there, which also need to be rewarded. A labour should always get a fair share of value that they add. What that fair share should be, depends on the country's situation, what a decent wage should be, in that place, and what kind of work the labour is doing. The amount of hardwork, as well as the labour's skills, also decide the pay, which isn't unethical as well.

A lot of Marxist ideologies are limited to low-skilled work force, working in production lines, where there are either no differential skills among them, or no added value being brought by those skills. I agree to those thoughts at similar places, but then militant commies try to force fit them in all the areas of life, which is now more like how religion works.",1,5,1640494875.0,ok_i_am_that_guy,1640495169.0,negative,negative,negative,negative
hqdr1wi,"You missed the hour part of the calculation.

6-8k per month from one family for 1 hour. Maids work at least 5-6 houses a day. Some up to 8 houses. So essentially 40-60k a month, which they certainly deserve (in fact, they should earn more), given that they work almost non-stop for 8-9 hours.

Also, one thing I missed mentioning that many maids work in pairs, so that they can finish the work faster, and can rotate shifts. So this 40-60k pm is the income of 2 family members/friends.

Those working alone mostly take less than 5 jobs a day, and work for more than 1 hour each, for the same money.

Most of these domestic helps are female, and they certainly earn more than their husbands (or have drunkard husbands, and are solely running their home). So their family income remains under 60-70 k pm. One of our neighbour was bitching about how her maid's child studies in the same school as their child, and how these maids are looting us, and making so much money. She was even complaining that her maid declined the generous gift of old torn clothes for her children.

Reason: It's really difficult to survive there, unless you have a wife, who can cook, clean and scrub at home.

And if the girl has any other ambitions, than being wife of an NRI, they will have a hard time together.

I honestly feel that there actually are many women, who are okay with it, or rather fancy that. But it would suck for a lot of women to be pushed into that kind of a marriage, where they are supposed to replace a maid.

Also, the reason why many parents start looking for a bride as soon as their son gets an onsite opportunity, are:

!. He isn't able to survive there, with no one to cook & clean.
2. The current dollar-converted salary number will act as a better chick magnet, and better dowry deals. So it's better to fix the knot before they come back to continue working on the Indian salaries.

I might be missing something, but so many people in Bangalore are paying Rs.7-10 k pm to their domestic help, which is more than what the US minimum wage seems like, if you look at purchasing power parity.

But the point is that, when someone's decision to go to USA, is not based on a PPP-analysis of what they are being paid there, so naturally, when it comes to paying salary themselves, they don't look at a more fair PPP based number, but that salary number seems like 30-40k to them, when converted to rupee, and then they feel it's too high.

Thats a strange question. Firstly, we already do that. It's like asking ""Why should I pay taxes for railway stations when I don't have to travel?""
