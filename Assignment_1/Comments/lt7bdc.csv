India is a beautiful country, but there is trash EVERYWHERE. They treat their rivers like a giant toilet.

Aside from friends, what interested me about India is their culture of spirituality/religion. Because of that, that's what got me into meditation and learning about the chakra system/sanskrit.

The way they act when it comes to sex is so weird, but unhealthy because they try to keep their natural instincts re/sup-pressed.

goyigis,"You've got your head deep up your backside. I am a 46-year old woman who has actually lived this. I married my husband when he was 45 years old. He was already divorced once largely because of his mother's meddling.

You'd think that a 75-year-old mother would be overjoyed to see her son remarry at 45. Yeah. Pigs will fly. On our wedding day, when my husband called her to inform her that he was married, she said, ""My children are dead to me"". When he returned home for the first time after his wedding, she opened the front door, glared at him, and stopped speaking to him.

My MIL stopped speaking to her son and daughter for three years for ""disobeying"" her. My husband was 45, his sister 50. My MIL was 75. They live in an expensive suburb in Mumbai where property prices and rents are sky-high. MIL owns a plush 3 BHK, which is the family home, that she inherited from her husband. 

MIL is also an 81-year-old orthodox Tamil Brahmin woman who has never been to the bank, never signed a cheque, never even taken a train or cab ride alone. Married at 18, with a class Xth education. Therefore, completely and entirely dependent on the son even for survival. That's the root of her insecurity -- the knowledge that would not survive one day without assistance from family.

So we had to rent an apartment in the same building as hers, and we lost all our savings paying a monthly rent of Rs 1.5 lakh. We had to, because MIL would stop taking her diabetes and BP medication, pass out on the floor and tell doctors and health workers that her son and DIL were ""neglecting"" her. 

Who would you believe? A frail 80-year-old, or her very educated, middle-aged son and DIL? 

You seem very young, and you have no experience of family dysfunction and psychological disorders. MIL refuses to see a psychiatrist, but I suspect that she would receive a ""Narcissistic Personality Disorder"" diagnosis. This stuff is real. Mothers are not always selfless angels. They can be destructive monsters who destroy their children's lives.

Everyone blames the British for ruining India (and they do deserve most of it), but independent governments fell way short of expectations. We lagged between every Asian country in the majority part of late 20th century. Nations like South Korea,Taiwan and Singapore which were worse off than India in all parameters in 1947 emerged as major powerhouses, while Indian generations were left in perpetual poverty.

For a nation of a glorious past to be deteriorated to a point of no return ( it's what the common people in the late 20th century used to perceive that India had no future. I personally do not subscribe to this thought process) can infuse a massive inferiority complex in the culture.  The power structures need to fight against this complex to justify their existence, and hence encourage blame shifting to deflect responsibility.

I watched something on youtube and even the guy looks at the ocean as a giant toilet where you can do your business, and the water will just ""take it away."" Not to mention the dead bodies in one of their most important rivers that run through India.

India is one of the most hospitable regions on earth, but it never had to support such a huge population. All of the religious ceremonies were developed in the context of a moderate population, but are now impractical in modern times. The growing awareness of unsustainable religious practices should atleast put off our next generations from continuing them.



>Only problem is these higher caste people think they're too good to pick up garbage or do any laborious work. Most people just want a cushy office job.

Infact, no body in the world likes a laborious work. In India, an abundance of unskilled labour means you get to be paid peanuts regardless of the efforts put in. Service industry pays a lot , not just in India but all over the world. It's seen as stepping stone to higher echelons of our society. No body wants to deteriorate their own social standing by opting to work in menial jobs like garbage cleaning or drainage work.

In India, travelling will take 1-2 hrs of time unless you're ultra rich and stay near your workplace. People work 9 hours instead of 8 hours in your USA. Go, keep chanting USA, USA and celebrate 4 th of July... Here, most people and I in my company stay till 7pm. I get paid a handsome amount for the work I do and I make sure to keep the discipline to not bring my work home but there will be times when I'll have to stay late. 

If I don't stay till 7 then I'll have to forget about my promotion and eventually they'll fire me. People here get fired if they keep refusing to attend meetings in the evening and you're talking about ""extra"" money. No job, no money. No money, forget about buying a home. 

In India,both husband and wife cannot be ambitious. It just won't work at all. Women will keep choosing men who earn more than them and after having kids, corporate might or might not hire them otherwise they'll pay them less. Now if they have to come back early to pick up their kids then their career will stagnate so their husbands have to earn more. My dad used to come home by 7 when we used to live in a small town and his factory was closeby. When we moved to a metro city, it took him 2 hours to reach home so he came at 9 and my mom understood. 

Even if you keep saying NO to staying late in office and sacrifice your career, things will keep getting expensive. Inflation is at 6% per year and if a couple doesn't want to depend on their kids after retirement then they'll need a lot of money. Otherwise they can go the traditional way, let their careers stagnate, live cheaply, not give their kids decent education and then after retirement depend on their kids for survival. If their kids ever kick them out then beg on the streets. Also, what if they have a daughter? After marriage will she be able to contribute? An average middle class couple after retirement nowadays will need approx 40-45k if they want to live peacefully with health insurance. I have been on matrimony sites and most women in the 25-28 year range earn 4-6 lakhs. That comes around 30-40k per month in hand. What happens after her marriage? Will she give her entire salary to her parents? Would any husband be fine with that? 

I don't want to be dependent on my kids and I don't need advice from NRIs like you who want to act all high and mighty. I will have time after 9pm and I'm free on weekends(half day for 2 Saturdays) so that's enough to spend quality time with my kids and my wife.

Even though you have no proof of that. Somehow NRIs especially trigger you? I just want to let you know that Suffering doesn’t make you a hero. Having children is a choice. It’s always a choice. You choose to bring them into the world in the context of your circumstances.  


Also One (my) persons opinion doesn’t really negate your ability to make a choice since you obviously have already had children despite you hating your job, life and circumstances. I’m not God here judging you though I’m flattered my comment made such a impact on you/ And honestly I feel sorry for you that you need to spew so much vitriol everywhere because of a comment on Reddit. I never said YOU specifically shouldn’t have kids.... but now maybe I reconsider my opinion. Hopefully you don’t pass on your anger onto your family and you use Reddit as a way to get rid of it. But I’m not going to engage with someone like you who obviously have some HUGE unresolved issues. I hope you live a good life and are able to overcome your circumstances as they obviously  are making you very unhappy...only saying this for the good of your kids. 

Edit/ I didn’t read your essay but by skimming I can see your mysoginy is glaring by bringing up my gender throughout your comment. Now I feel sorry for your wife also.",6,1,1614472124.0,nanon_2,1614472323.0,negative,negative,negative,negative
