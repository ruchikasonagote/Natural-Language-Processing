gwe4gtt,"Mallu here , I can say that from day 1 of kerala's inception the development has always been people centric . Though it sometimes impede big business development.  
eg: The labor charges are highest in India , giving it the nick name 'Gulf of India'  
Trade unions and political parties do impact -vely on big tickets projects undertaken by  colgomerates like adani / cococola if it is observed to pollute the environment or kill competition. That is why you may not see much big highways and highrise buildings. Or any Ambani/Adani coming out of kerala  
Now the  good part . All govts focused on education to be equitable . Asias largest girls school is in kerala . women have key positions in all institutions. People don't belittle any kind of work . Iv seen NRIs returning home take up food delivery business / selling fish etc as long as it is profitable.   
From Health sector aspect . Sailaja teacher has a vary good reponse team  (No politicians only educated Doctors ). In the past when there was Nipah attack (a far deadly virus with 70% mortality rate) they formed the fundamental play book which is applied / improvised even now. It was effective as Nipa claimed only single digit deaths (as far as i remember). The response team is good at anticipating the after maths and that is why they had the intelluct to invest in O2 plants . They had evaluated considerable case studies from Italy and geographies where health system crubled and came to simple conclusion that mortality can be reduced if then can delay the curve and ensure availability of ventilators and O2  
 The health care system is far more robust as it was not built over night . And govt has not been reluctant to embrace tech as long as it is effective and available at a low cost. If you look at the mortality rate in kerala due to covid , it is 1/3rd that of states with equal infection rate . That being said , Kerala has a far higher people density compared to other states, yet this feat  was achieved .   
The main bottomline is that the Govt has shown good leadership and had taken responsibility to its hands not shying away at times of disaster . During the floods / covid or any disaster CM Vijayan used to address the ppl every day and provide the stats . This kept the masses engaged in the process and we knew what was going on. Even when vaccines where declared at a price 400Rs for 18-45 aged . CM offered them for free , and opened a CM fund effectively relying on the ppl who can afford to distribute vaccines for the poor as well.

gwef62n,"> quality of education : subpar, caste-based politics : yes, communal hatred : yes.

Quality of education is something of a national thing. Most progressive areas have this problem.Like being obsessed with just two or three types of profession and forcing children to follow one of these that inturn makes them incompetent. Its a side effect of a culture that prioritises education over everything .

As a former neet aspirant in Kerala, I can assure you that you need much higher marks and ranks in these all India examinations than most of the other states to get into a regional government college.(Same goes for getting into the homestate quota for NIT calicut. Seeing the Cut-off marks for the other states is the only time when you wish you were born in some other states.) But when it comes to quality infrastructure in colleges, I think Kerala is somewhat behind.

Caste based politics is definitely there. Caste based atrocity, not so much. Even if people have caste based superiority( tbh, its definitely there ), they keep it in their minds because they know its something scorned by general public. This is the case for communal(Hindu - muslim)hatred too. People might have it but it didn't comeout until BJP started gaining a bit of popularity since 2014. Even then, people like this end being ostracized by the Malayalam media and the public.

 Kerala has quite a lot of flaws: We are still too conservative for a progressive state when it comes to women's dressing and family concepts. Believe me, a 17 year old actress wearing shorts became quite controversial here.  Pub and club culture is not tolerated at all, save for Kochin. People still opt for caste based arranged marriages.

Political killings are a problem here when compared to other states  but I think it's gotta do a lot with each and every case getting necessary media attention and a publicized trial .

Excuse me? I more-or-less agree with the other statements. Kerala is no perfect haven, has many underlying problems (which admittedly, are often overlooked by people praising reforms) but calling the education ""subpar"" is laughable. Kerala has the highest literacy rate, yes, but that doesn't mean they've sacrificed the quality of education. Their government schools are one of the best in India, and they give importance to skill-based learning. There's actually high demand to get into government schools, parents are shifting their kids from private schools to public ones- there must be something great in the teaching-learning there then, don't you think? 

At least compared to states like Karnataka where public education is in shambles and schools are more business-minded and less educating, I think you are severely underestimating Kerala's education and its quality.

I've heard before in the past Kerala stands out in India for its high literacy rates and levels of education etc. before.

But also knowing that migrant labor and state of origin remain important cultural divides (definitely not just in India), one question I've always had when I hear these facts is how those education rates are counted. 

In India and Kerala, is literacy / education / access to healthcare etc. based just on those born in Kerala? Those born in Kerala with family ties to Kerala? Or are a lot of these stats really just based on people native to Kerala, Malayalam speakers etc. and perhaps excludes populations like migrant workers from other states (and their children)?

 It's jsut that when you're poor, you cant discrimate with food, you eat what you get and then if you're still alive, you devote time to your gods.

The Christians run a convent school for kids of all religions/castes and it is funded by the community. They also pay for a lot of things like meds and doctors( although we have a govt run hospital which is entirely free ofc).

The Hindus are incharge small to medium businesses, and hire anyone they can find. Delhi me pehle surname poochhte hain lol.

My dad has a iron/cement workshop...the cement workshop is run by women like 8 labours and the iron workshop has male ones. The woman labourers have been working before I was born, and still do, they have their own kids that hand out at our house daily. 

The men labourers get more privileges like we give them house/transport facilities and even then they spend everything on booze 😒.

It's just an unspoken rule that, women are more hardworking than men (except when it comes to dadagiri lol). There are issues no doubt but it's still all a cohesive ecosystem. 

I realised my noob dad/ community is more progressive than some political parties who either only talk of women empowerment/ religious and communal harmony but don't actually do anything but virtue signalling and mindless religious comparisons. 

Odisha has extreme climates sometimes, so when there's a famine, literally everyone suffers. So to the ppl of my village it become very obvious early on that if you don't support the ppl around you, you're gonna get fucked to Babus/Netas from the cities.

gwfgsus,"OP, I have been following this entire thread. And by the end of this comment, I had tears in my eyes. I can't explain how happy your snippet about your village made me. 

I have seen communal Harmony ofcourse (I'm a Mallu).. but I always thought it was limited to Kerala (ik.. that's just dumb, but I knew no better). To read about your village was both surreal and an absolute joy. There are so few instances of humanity and camaraderie these days. This was god sent. 

Know that I consider the people of your state, kin. I would love to visit someday.",2,2,1619793090.0,iemanh,False,positive,positive,neutral,positive

gwfxu7w,"Thanks for the love 🤗 and yeah I agree.

Idk of toi( I don't read it cos it's shit, idk if it's biased it's full of shit ads) but India Today and republic tv is 🙏

If you love english speaking parrots who spit out lies for breakfast, lunch and dinner ,who earn in a year more than ud ever earn in a lifetime, then that's for you.  

So if you think some  filthy rich news anchor has the best in mind for avg person then hahaha.

Lol, nk when I say that I was actually an Arnab fan from 2015-2017. 

Aaand to all the people who are still stuck at Libbus vs Bhakts , just know that Cambridge Analytica ke clients were from both BJP and Congress. 

Just the level of chutiyaap differs between the two parties. 

It's all on Google guys, please educate yourselves and feel free to point me out if I'm wrong.",1,2,1619800404.0,D-3-V,False,negative,negative,neutral,negative
gwefx9i,"Yep, and I'm glad BJP is out of your state. I hope there's some strong regional party like we do to take care of the people there. I haven't read about Jharkhand in a while.",2,3,1619769927.0,D-3-V,False,neutral,positive,positive,positive
gwfp1wk,"Arre bro 😭 glad to know that such things still exist, and not just in my state. Frankly every state must learn from Kerala.

And NO U DONT HAVE TO BE A ""COMMUNIST""(before ppl flip the shit out)  to give people their basic rights, and treat them with dignity and respect. It's just common sense .

 I'm not a religious person but I'd pray every day that we come together as people across all these divisive lines..like akhandbharat needs to happen in spirit not just a adworthy twitter tag.

Just know nothing can divide people , not poverty,or race, religion or caste as long as we are  just Indians, we don't need more labels frankly.

For instance Doritos and Cheetos ek doosre ke lete rehte hai but they belong to same parent company. So we literally share a single mother (India).
 
Pls stop listening to politicians who say otherwise, THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO LISTEN TO US, NOT THE OTHERWAY AROUND. 

If people speak up everyone will listen so pls speak to unite, not divide. 🙏",2,3,1619796679.0,D-3-V,False,negative,positive,positive,positive
gwitp59,"Well we might have had a few in Bengal and south by now if it wasn't for covid and the farmer's protest.

We're slowly becoming an overtly religious state, and authoritarian state. All that struggle for independence just to become slaves to our own ppl.

gwhf6xe,"Analytica actually ducked over congress because some “London based businessman” pushed them to go all in for BJP.

This was a massive social conditioning campaign and to some extent it’s still on. I was indifferent for a long time but once you see how disgusting their actual goal is (and you see the goal once you start seeing through the fine print and fake news they try and amplify), it makes you realise they’re just a bunch of fragile low IQ idiots with an inferiority complex. This inferiority complex is deep among the RSS but their fragile masculinity is a topic for another time.",1,3,1619825124.0,,False,negative,negative,negative,negative
gwegefb,"No strong regional party though. As to why you haven’t heard about Jharkhand is because of course no one covers it in media - hell even when their are elections in the state, there is barely any coverage. Most people know that Jharkhand exists because of Dhoni, to some extent maybe because of Tata and recently because of maybe Gangs of Wasseypur (lol). Apart from that we really don’t have much that tells things about our state. Student crowd knows the state because of maybe XLRI, ISM Dhanbad and IIM Ranchi. But when I go to other state and someone asks me where do I hail from and I tell them Jharkhand - all they tell me is - achcha bihari ho. Dude, thanks for that comment but honestly that state is my hometown and I consider it to be a part of my identity. And when I do say that it is not Bihar, they are like it was earlier. It pisses me off so much - like dude by that logic a billion years ago the entire world was one. 

But then even our government hasn’t done anything to create an identity of its own.",3,4,1619770369.0,Av_Inash,False,negative,neutral,negative,negative

gwhgk4g,"Haha true, but whtd u expect from boomer flag bearers of patriarchy. In 2017, i came across an article in the Indian express about the top 100 powerful ppl in india. 

Teesre pe Bhagwat after Modi and Amit Shah, and I didn't know much abt him back then and I'm like this dude might be third on paper but Modi and Shah obv hold him in high regards which means my country's being ruled by a dinosaur and I had no clue about it.

Thats when I was first disillusioned how one sided our media is.

Gujarat is the biggest hub for diamond polishing so it rakes in a shit ton of cash from tons of businessmen all over the world. So not totally far fetched to think Gujarat might have international ties. 

Also, if you can read abt the Rafale case, i might be a bit off base here but as far as I remember either anil or mukesh paid for a movie where the the French Presidents wife acted...and somehow got around 8-10bn$ part of the deal. Nt sure abt the exact details of the business deal but it's a good example of crony capitalism.

Hence the rise of chelas in this day and age.",1,4,1619825821.0,D-3-V,False,neutral,neutral,positive,neutral
gwfv27u,"The last statement perfectly sums up all the issues in our country. 

And thank you, it always feels good to meet a like-minded soul. 

Well at the end of the day, all people have to ask is the kind of nation they want to live in tomorrow? Te kind where ppl keep pointing out each other's shortcomings or the kind where they fill in for each other's weaknesses.

I guess the both of us, and a few others have thought about this and we have our answers. I wish the rest of us figure this out as well, cos uh...we running out of time.
