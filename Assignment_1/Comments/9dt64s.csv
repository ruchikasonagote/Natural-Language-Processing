e5judns,"Man, I wish more Indian parents were supportive of their kids. It makes a huge difference when your parents back you up rather than when you have to fight every battle on your own.

> Sexuality is a part of your identity and not your identity. Everyone takes their own time to accept themselves thereafter its a journey of self-awareness and owning your personality traits. Two years ago I lived a life which was not letting me live like a free bird. The dual in my mind was strong enough to let me be unsure of who am I. Then started my journey of self-exploration through socializing with folks from the community and their life values and experiences helped me deal with this battle in my head. I came out to my dearest friend Nikhil on his Birthday and felt that I gain the honest trust by telling my true story. My life changed at the very moment. It felt as if a butterfly coming out of a cocoon. Soon I started coming out to my brothers I gained in college and their response was heart melting. My parents live in a conservative surrounding and didn‚Äôt want them to get hurt/taunted by other because of my sexuality. It was hurting me to keep this within but I don‚Äôt want to be that selfish thus I took time and the time was right I got the courage to let them know about my lifestyle. The reaction was not negative and I feel privileged. But the doubts were real in the lines of biological problems ( impotency, erectile dysfunction etc ) which the society claims to make a man less of man. They needed time and thus I waited to not come out in public to protect them.

I learnt that my mother started sensitizing the folks around her. My Dad is a govt employee and this law was holding him back to fight for me in the fear of what such laws create in the mind of our parents. Today on this historic day 6/9 (what a damn day, brings back the college nostalgia of my obsession with the number 069 starting from the ID number which I got in college) my parents are so happy that she told me ‚ÄúNow go broadcast it‚Äù ‚ÄúAcha hai abhi koi ladhki ka rishta leke nahi aayega‚Äù (Good now that we won't get marriage proposals of girls for you).

The results are disgusting indeed.

Indians aren‚Äôt as privileged as the people from countries like the US. If we have a problem , we can‚Äôt bend and twist it on social media, like the alt right in the US do.

Our country might get called a shithole and this and that. But we just keep improving everyday. Becoming better and better.

We used to be a country where everyone supposedly shat on the street. We solved that problem by about 95%. 
This week we lifted the ban on homosexuality, next time we‚Äôll probably ban forced arranged marriage, take punishment of corruption seriously. Develop our roads and infrastructure ( already working on that). Make sure idiots don‚Äôt become our president or PM (I think we did that), end religious communalism. Clean our country up.

That's the point, you can't. So there's no special law needed for bestiality. It gets covered in cruelty against animals or by the fact that its non consensual. Also that law considered sex between two consenting adults and sex with animals as the same level of criminality. So while it protected animals, it unfortunately completely failed to do so for humans. ",2,4,1536334539.0,BigBulkemails,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

That raises an interesting point... I have seen dogs hump the owners leg or other accessible body parts. This might be construed as a sexual move. What's your opinion in such cases?

Also, birds are known to hump their owners hands (or other body parts)... you can find youtube videos on that very easily. The ""sexually attracted to a person"" seems like a dicey part of the wording.
