fl89w4o,"In Europe people started freaking out when celebrities started getting sick and dying, and politicians started dropping down dead or collapsing in TV on Parliament and they realised they were on their own and this disease gets you in seconds. 

Social distancing doesn't work because the virus survives for 3 hours in cold North European air (even longer in hot humid tropical air like we have), and for 3 days on most surfaces like food or stores where you buy your food. 

I tried warning my colleagues in Mumbai and even said you can still buy the cure for 58 rupees ($0.60 Cents) in pharmacies here, pharmacy Wallas didn't even know what they were handing out was now worth thousands of Dollars on eBay in the US and Japan, and would even order boxes more from the manufacturer... Now the entire rich Western world and rich Asia has bought up the supply for years to come, and since it's an organic based medication it will take years or even decades to make enough for the Southern Hemisphere. 

I don't even think people here realise the scale of fucked India is.... China lied, there are people still dying there, we now know even in the most advanced developed countries in the world the death rate is about 6% - 8%, the only difference is how long your country can keep the needed ratio of one doctor per two or three respirators to constantly adjust them going before they start dropping down sick or dead too... We also now know young people are just as badly effected, if not worse, they just take longer to have their lung function permanently eaten away by the virus (the dry cough that seemingly goes on forever), until you just keel over or drop down dead like a stroke patient (you just collapse after 30 days choking on pink foam like they're seeing in New York).  

Oh, and China mobile lost 7.8 million customers in a single month (their only one state mobile company), and 5 million landline / internet subscribers in Wuhan alone. 

I tried telling all my friends and colleagues here in India, and warning my family in Australia. I even offered to get the medication for them even if they didn't believe it, I WORK IN MEDICINE AND STILL NOBODY BELIEVED ME! Even in Australia it's summer party BBQ season still, out of sight out of mind I guess. 

Only one person paid attention, a cosmetic surgeon in Mumbai, she took the time to read the studies I'd received and understand why the specific combo of medicine would work even for a virus all your medical instincts are telling you it shouldn't work on...

There's also already 2 major families of the virus that have evolved that we've seen in autopsies, one is still fatal but gets you quietly, the other is much more aggressive and very brutal, and affects young people worse than old (this was theorised based on our data on the Spanish Flu). There should also be a third strain evolving soon and clinical outcomes seem to be supporting that theory.
