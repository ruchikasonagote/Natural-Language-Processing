fusbqgu,"I was going to link to the National Suicide Helpline. But it's not very helpful. 

So, if anyone needs to talk, please message.

r/SuicideWatch helps too. 

There will be many who will offer to talk to you. Even if it feels silly and pointless, give it a shot? What's to lose, right?

I know this will sound hollow, especially if you're going through what you're going through, but I'll say it nonetheless. 

You aren't as insignificant as your mind likes you to believe. You matter. And usually, things do get better. And people care for you. I don't care if this sounds fake, but I promise I care for you. So, that's one person right here. 

If you look for a moment, you'll find reddit full of cunts like us, ready to talk. 

We love you. 

If you're on reddit, you're most likely a cool person to begin with. Nerdy and smelly, sure. But cool. 

Yes, it's vain and masturbatory. But it's nice.

Don't let the annoying parts of your mind win, if you can. You've been dealt a bad hand. I know! I believe you. Life can be incredibly unfair. And you don't deserve this horrid shit. And Covid is making it worse. I,100%, get it.

But let's try giving it another shot or two. (I know you've given it plenty. But you're on r/India so give it another just to be a pain in the ass to your own mind, you petty, spiteful bastard.)

This place can seem awfully polarizing and political at times. But trust me, it's full of some of the most beautiful people you'll ever meet. People who are equally weird, sad, smelly, nerdy, argumentative. But really very nice to talk to. 

I'll be here, every day, between 9 pm to 11 pm for a week. And I will 100% reply.

""The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. 

""The person in whom its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. 

""Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant.

""It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""

fuszcb8,"Manoj Bajpai on Sushant Singh Rajput

We worked together recently in Sonchiriya that I regard as one of the best films of my career and an unmatchable experience. We got to know each other on location and the hotel we were living in. I had known of him before that through my dear friend Neeraj Pandey who had directed him in M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story. He was bullheaded in his approach to that role and went all the way for it, even though he may have never played cricket before. Every morning and evening he would religiously go out for his practice sessions with [former Indian wicketkeeper] Kiran More. He played the role so well, the manner in which he imbibed the essence of Dhoni was impeccable.

I have always been more inclined towards an actor trying to excel than an actor who is already excellent. The latter stay there forever. But it is such a pleasant sight to see someone search for that perfect shot, that perfect expression, the perfect craft. He did that.

What I would remember him for is his curiosity for space, how well read a person he was and the talented and hardworking actor that we have lost. He used to be in his own world, reading. I remember him carrying books on quantum physics to the location. He used to carry an expensive pair of binoculars with him, would look at the space out there in the night and invite all of us to gaze at the galaxies under the Chambal sky. I remember him talking about developing an app with the help of his friends. I remember him talking about seeking peace away from the hustle and bustle of the city, the grand house that he had built for himself at Pavnar and how proud he was of it. It’s very difficult for the industry to accept someone who talks intelligently and of things other than films.

I remember him for a foodie that he was and how he loved the mutton I used to cook at the shoot. How we’d discuss having him over home for it. My only regret is that I couldn’t invite him home for that for the lack of time.  

It’s futile to pinpoint a reason for his death. Media thrives on these incidents and I had to switch off the television for the cacophony getting built around him. Jumping to conclusions is gross injustice to the soul of the one who has departed. Let’s not become so small [by doing that]. We must regard him for what he was--a much revered star and actor. What matters is the shock that everyone is feeling now that he is gone. How difficult it must be for the family and friends to come to terms with such a loss in these times. For me he is like a little boy actor who left us way too early. May god bless him in his journey onwards, may things get more peaceful for him.

I am  16 and a half. I have been depressed for the past 1 year since I joined 11th grade. My family was  very financially well off  as my father had a very high post  in a company but it all took a turn when my dad left his job  for personal reasons last year . I had to leave the school that I had been studying for the past 6 years and join a simple   school for my 11th grade. I was in a totally new atmosphere and I hated it and still hate it.
My friends kept teasing me for joining such a school to such a level that it started getting me depressed which inturn reduced my productivity in studies and socializing to a great extent. From someone who excelled in almost everything the previous year I turned to a complete nobody who didn't seem to show interest in anything and was infact not good at anything. To get away with all this I started doing various  activities that I don't want to talk about along with my friends thinking that it'll be a solution to this , but it didn't  really seem to work and I eventually stopped it right b4 this corona thing.My friends used to do it for the thrill of it but I just did it to get away with all the bs happening in my life.
Along with the reduction in my productivity in various things I lost a large chunk of friends last year because I shifted schools.
I got so bad at studies that I passed 11th grade just by passing marks .I just can't seem to accept the reality and move on.
Not being able to achieve anything in my deciding years makes me really sad and makes me wonder how I'll face the world after my 12th grade.
My parents don't have the slightest hint of what I've been going through as everyone has their own problems to deal with .Ig  my parents are quite open to me telling them about my situation but I don't want them to know what a loser I've become.
Unlike everyone else this quarantine had been a blessing as I didn't have to see the faces of so many snitches fir a long time and I am currently enjoying my life even though I know this enjoyment will be short-lived by me only for a few months till school starts.

fusksh3,"""The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""

futhf5g,"Mental health, unlike physical health, does not manifest in visible alarming symptoms.. depression doesn’t scream out for help as does something like diabetes.. Depression aur baaki mental health issues mein naak nahi behti aur bukhaar bhi nahi aata.. Toh phir pata kaise chalega khud ko bhi ki depressed ho? Koi test kits aati hai? Nahi. Unfortunately this lack of visible deterioration is one major reason that we don’t talk about mental health as a serious issue. 

Unlike accidents, viruses and other ailments, where mostly the cause of death is unwilling, suicide is a very willing act. Something has to really go very very wrong in ones head, to resort to something as big and tragic as giving up on life. Khushi khushi toh koi aisa nahi karta na? Fir a person aged 34, I’m sure he knew he could ask for help, but he didn’t. Or maybe he did, and that wasn’t enough. 

I can only speak for myself, and as much as I want to believe this, no I don’t and cannot understand what pushed someone to kill oneself. I cannot understand depression sitting at home. It is much much more complicated and layered than we can all imagine sitting on our couches. If only depression and other mental health issues were so easy to diagnose and treat.. if only..

So what can you do? Start a dialogue. Talk about it in open. Raise your voice against the stigma of mental health. You never know that the quiet person you see everyday at your office, bus, train, who looks ‘normal’, might be masking a storm beneath that normal behaviour.

His acting in kai po che increased by interest in cricket. I have watched MS DHONI a 1000times for his versatile acting. Chichhore thought me the importance of life.

He was an amazing actor. He had a beautiful smile. Absolutely rattled and painful to know he committed suicide out of depression.

This incident is a great example of how people can have all the success, money & fame, yet have deteriorating mental health. This should create awareness to us how depression has no face. Let's not judge his battles and show our solidarity.

Every human is vulnerable no matter who and what they are. No one knows what a person is going through, and there can be no person who can sort out the reason for his depression other than him. You will always be missed Sushant.

Maybe that emptiness finally broke him?

My father lost his mother at a very young age. I've seen him be so successful over the years.

But even today he says, the only thing he desires is to take all the wealth he's earned and place it at his mother's feet. And then he cries and says that's one thing that he can't get, no matter how hard he tries.

Suffering approaches and reveals itself as the possibility of  the denial of will; but the will rejects it, in that it destroys the  body, the manifestation of itself, in order that it may remain unbroken.  But if a human being was ever restrained from committing suicide by  purely moral motives, the inmost meaning of this self-conquest was this:  “I will not shun suffering, in order that it may help to put an end to  the will to live, whose manifestation is so wretched, by so  strengthening the knowledge of the real nature of the world which is  already beginning to dawn upon me, that it may become the final quieter  of my will, and may free me for ever.”

fusvhkg,"Hi, so the first thing I would like to recommend to you is to meet yourself where you are in life. If you are able to accept and be loving towards yourself then that is a significant step that you would be taking. For instance, avoid using the term 'loser' to describe yourself. Language matters.You went through a significant life change and had difficulties in coping. You are already acknowledging it and that is a good sign of taking stock of your situations. Sometimes, we expect ourselves to react positively to everything. That is not the case everytime. So be cognizant of the struggles you have had, accept it, and only then will you be able to make any changes to get back on track. Also be kind to yourself. Please. 

If you are going through mood changes and feeling lethargic or fatigued, and have been going through periods of low mood, know that it is NOT YOU, but symptoms of your disorder. Talk to someone, preferably a mental health professional. You already took a step by posting about this here. It means that you are wanting to get better. So trust your instincts. Until then understand that the changes in your mood are not reflective of yourself, rather a symptom of the disorder you are suffering from.  

You report that you are enjoying the quarantine. I would suggest that you look at the reasons why. And try and engage in those activities or be with the people that are making you feel better. Have the courage to demand better of your friends. Talk to your parents about your mental health concerns. You would be surprised by their reaction. 

And finally, studies and academics are all well and good. We need marks in this country, we know that. However, trust me when I say this that the people who love you, and yes there will be a lot of such people despite what the depression goon in your head tries to sell to you otherwise, the people who love you would rather have a healthier, happier you besides them, anyday. 

Hope this helps.

I'm a stranger on be internet, and I may not be the best person to help you, but they certainly are. 

I know at that age we don't want to have a heart to heart with parents, but depression is not a joke. Please take the first step and tell them you need their help.

I know that's hard to believe right now but trust me, if they aren't being understanding of your hardship then why do they deserve your attention? Take this opportunity at your new school as a challenge to push yourself to the top.  If it truly is much easier then your old school then see if you can be one of the top students in your class which may not have been possible at your other school.  Look to make new friends at your new school.  The best thing you can do is spend time doing things you enjoy.  Join a club or a sports team or even a study group.  Meet people who have the same interests as you and form bonds over those interests. The old friends who are worth keeping will come around eventually and the ones who don't aren't worth your time. Your school was never important in defining you as a person. It was always you who made yourself special and changing schools does not make you less intelligent or less of a person. It may be difficult now and seem like things won't get better but they will and it dosent matter where you get your education as long as you find ways to challenge yourself and work hard. It's ok if you had a lapse in productivity it happens to all of us and your situation sounds extremely stressful.  Just know that you have plenty of time to bounce back from this and you can prove all of your old friends wrong if that's what you want and you put your mind to it. If your parents are open then it may be a good idea to tell them how you feel and to seek help because having someone to talk to is extremely important.  If you don't want to go that route then see if your school has a counselor you can confide in. Schools here in America have counselors specifically for the situation you are describing and can help you find resources to get through this.  Otherwise you can always inbox me and I am willing to listen and give advice for what its worth. Just remember that you are an amazing person and nothing anyone else says about you or what school you go to defines you. You control your own destiny and you are worth putting in the work for.

You seem to be really strong though for being able to express all this in such a mature, thoughtful manner - Kudos to you! Very few people at your age would have had the courage and maturity to reach out - I think you're quite awesome for reaching out :)

I would suggest that you pick up things you're interested in - maybe pick up an instrument to learn, or join the gym. These things really helped me.   


Try to make small incremental progress on a daily basis. It might seem insignificant or inconsequential on a daily basis, but trust me, a few years later you will be blown away by the overall progress you've made! As humans, we tend to overestimate what we can do in a day but underestimate what can be done over years.   


Look to make small incremental progress every day - just one small positive thing for the day, like cleaning your room or going for a walk or decorating your house/stuff. Keep doing this, and in some time, you'll be amazed at how much progress you've made :)

fut2w84,"Hi, I am 41 years old. I had a tough time in 11th and 12th std and was in a similar situation where I was not doing well in studies or sports or w.r.t friends.

One of my classmates committed suicide during this time. That is when I understood how much pressure some of us were really in. And I just backed off from all expectations I was putting on myself.

Eventually things turned out ok for me. I even had fun towards the end of my 12th std.

You have to understand that your friends are also young like you and some of them do not know that they can be hurtful sometimes. Eventually they will also grow up and become more understanding. I promise you college life will be much more enjoyable. And your 20s-30s even better. I cannot tell you about 40s since i just turned 40 recently :)

Here are **some things to keep in mind**:

**1)** However imaginative you can try to be, **you cannot guess how the future will look like** \- contrary to a lot of people's imaginations, their futures are much much much better than they could have ever guessed.

**2) Do whatever you can w.r.t studies** \- someone who is crawling is still moving i.e. do not give up completely ever. Eventually, something will click and you will start doing much better

**3) Join a gym and start working out** \- when you work out, you can see transformation in your body; this will teach you **an important lesson in life** \- that with effort, you can change your circumstances.

If joining a gym is not an option, just workout at home and go running or even walking regularly.

Also a lesser known fact about fitness is - **you need to be fit to sit and study for long periods of time** (and your stomach needs to be full too). Fitness was the reason that yogis invented yoga and buddhist monks invented martial arts like kung-fu - just to be fit enough to sit for long periods of time.

**4) Eat well & Sleep well** \- this might sound like simple advice, but I made this mistake of not eating enough; make sure to find some food that you like and is healthy; never be hungry; you will need good energy to help you in doing anything;

Food & Sleep are the fuel for our body & mind.

**5) Finally, have courage**, be strong, and **be nice** to everyone around you especially your family - this might be difficult at times, but believe me, it will be worth it.

(You will realize this only much later in life).

**6) Good or bad, we have to face everything with dignity.**

And life has a way of rewarding people who can keep their dignity even in the worst of times.",3,1,1592148499.0,theacadianishere,1592149154.0,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral

fusx10j,"My dad used to work in a bank. We transferred all the time. When I entered my 10th I moved from a town to a city and faced similar judgement and loneliness.
My dad didn't know what was going on with me but knew that I was struggling. He gave me a book called ""who moved my cheese"" to help cope with that situation. That is the only book my dad asked me to read so far. It helped.

But the most important part of this equation is you. If they are harsh to you in your time of struggle, then they're not your friends. You are better off without them. Their judgement of you is not important. What is important is what you think about yourself. If you look towards a""quick fix"" to make yourself feel better.. Can be anything.. gaming, movies, social media, food, drugs.. You'll be addicted.

  If you busy yourself in a constructive activity that you enjoy and spend the next 3 months getting good at it, you'll gradually come out of your mental state.  I would suggest to avoid contact with anyone who is not your true friend during this time as at this time you'll be sensitive to their judgement. Try to be more methodical. Maybe look into stoic teachings.. They help build resilience. I try to follow this video every morning to keep myself level headed.

fusijix,"Therapy might be expensive to some but even then there's a lot of things physically healthy people can do themselves to help with depression without any sides you get from medication if anybody's worried about that while also improving other markers of health along the way.

This is what I do in their order of effectiveness and importance based on the evidence I've seen so far:

1. Exercise and healthy BMI
2. Anti-inflammatory diet with a variety of unprocessed foods.
3. Fish consumption for long chain Omega-3s especially EPA because supplements don't seem to work as well. If vegetarian, try eating more ALA-rich foods like ground flaxseeds, conversion rate isn't that good but there's no algae oil supplements with EPA in the market rn.
4. Vitamin D- Deficiency linked to depression. Only 5% indians have sufficient levels. Correcting any nutrient deficiency may help.
5. Avoid BPA- BPA from plastic reduces testosterone which worsens mood.
6. Saffron- has evidence to be as effective as some popular antidepressants, I think they're sensationalising but it might still prove to be effective and safe.
7. Nigella sativa seeds(kalonji)- boosts mood even in healthy young adults.
8. Boron- soils today are deficient in boron. Complements vitamin D & exercise and boosts testosterone.
9. Curcumin- anti-inflammatory, may help with depression. Can't get meaningful amounts from turmeric. I try to not take a lot of it as that could have too much of a bloodthinning effect. Don't recommend if you're on bloodthinners.

All of them are well backed by science and also relatively affordable and safe. I didn't list a few other supplements that I take like ALCAR or creatine because they have weaker evidence for depression.

Listen to some good music. I recommend some uplifting music. Being mainly into metal, Linkin Park's songs really help me through, but could push you instead more deeper, so look out for that too.

Watch a new movie/series/sitcom, if time permits you that. By the time you get engaged in the storyline, you unintentionally forget a lot of things that were making you low. I'd recommend sitcoms, one episode of The Office/Friends could be great!

Regardless if someone's afraid of the sides from medication or if therapy's too expensive, this is what I do listed in their order of effectiveness and importance based on evidence for depression I've seen so far:

1. Exercise and healthy BMI
2. Anti-inflammatory diet with a variety of unprocessed foods.
3. Fish consumption for long chain Omega-3s especially EPA because supplements don't seem to work as well. If vegetarian, try eating more ALA-rich foods like ground flaxseeds, conversion rate isn't that good but there's no algae oil supplements with EPA in the market rn.
4. Vitamin D- Deficiency linked to depression. Only 5% indians have sufficient levels. Correcting any nutrient deficiency may help.
5. Avoid BPA- BPA from plastic reduces testosterone which worsens mood.
6. Saffron- has evidence to be as effective as some popular antidepressants, I think they're sensationalising but it might still prove to be effective and safe.
7. Nigella sativa seeds(kalonji)- boosts mood even in healthy young adults.
8. Boron- soils today are deficient in boron. Complements vitamin D & exercise and boosts testosterone.
9. Curcumin- anti-inflammatory, may help with depression. Can't get meaningful amounts from turmeric. I try to not take a lot of it as that could have too much of a bloodthinning effect. Don't recommend if you're on bloodthinners.

All of them are well backed by science and also relatively affordable and safe. I didn't list a few other supplements that I take like ALCAR or creatine because they have weaker evidence for depression.

Trust me when I say this, it wouldn't have been worth the one year of extra prep. My time in Kota instilled a deep inferiority complex in me, which I fight till the date. It's been 6 years now though, I am at a much better place. There are still times when I doubt myself.

As Jeetu said in Kota Factory, ""Bache to Kota se nikal jaate hai, Kota saalo tak bacho se nahi nikalta"".

'Black man commits crime' is perfectly acceptable in any form because the Noun, Black man, is performing some action and commits is a strong action verb because it specific. That doesn't change in past, present or future.

>'Black man commits crime' is perfectly acceptable in any form because the Noun, Black man, is performing some action and commits is a strong action verb because it specific. That doesn't change in past, present or future.

We are getting into the semantics of technical grammar. But I guess that's fair game in this discussion.

futugdb,"First of all,  it's amazing that you were able to grasp the positive aspects, and I'm grateful this happened to you. 

Suicide arising from depression and/or anxiety has many complex factors arising from it and even more complex consequences resulting from it, and many people react even more differently from it.

The impact of changing the language in describing the situations is undescribable.

Language is everything. 

As a person who has also suffered from periodical depression myself, this is what I have understood from my reading on this subject. 

(Reddit is not the ideal place for this, but I'll give it a shot)

The idea, that you yourself are responsible for whether you commit suicide, is completely true.

The language in serving that message to vulnerable people is absolutely where it gets fucked up for victims, professionals and the general populace.

And human beings respond to language in amazing ways, and there are singular words that can trigger positive and negative actions and consequences, whether you seek those words or come across them accidentally.

There are very strong people, like you, who can in fact overcome the language barriers as they were and grasp the positive and seize control.  Like you said, you were able to identify and work your way through your sheer efforts. 

There are also just as many people for whom this control over language and ideas, is inconsistent at best, despite the very best of their efforts.  It could be due to n number of reasons (economy, education, social structure, bad hormonal structure of the body, neutral complications etc) 

Obviously, what is inspiring for one may be recognized as judgemental for the other.  And what may be helpful for a large section, may come off as weak and ineffectual for others needing specific help.

News media and social media however can't fine tune such messages because they can't read the readers psychological profiles, no matter how much data they collect from their cookies.

But as a whole , it is better to assume there are a lot of people more likely to take clinical messages with more negative consequences in their lives, rather people taking the same words in a positive context and with positive consequences.

Can this change over time? Sure, its possible. Human society always changes and adapts. Maybe one day there will come a day where suicide contagion won't be a valid fear any

I agree, the very first SSRI I tried had worked perfectly in just a month or two. And I'm the type of guy who's more prone to nocebo effect than placebo. Had to quit overtime cause of the night sweats which lead to worse sleep. Imo exercise, correcting any nutritional deficiencies if any, should come before antidepressants. But I don't believe someone depressed would actually exercise if told that it would work.

>Ultimately, maybe a holistic approach to mental health, with exercise, medication and whatever else is the right way to go. Who knows.

Yeah, clearly exercise isn't a cure. Sushant Singh Rajput did seem to exercise besides doing a few other things based on his insta post from a month ago even during lockdown. He was also apparently on antidepressants. There's very little that could be done in his case with any additional dietary interventions and supplements alone based on current evidence. 

This is what I do based on what I've read so far, although some are supplements and do not work as well as pharmaceutical drugs even though some studies show them equally effective, I think their safety makes them worth the try. Only thing I'd be worried about my stack is too much bloodthinning from curcumin so I try not to take too much.

3) Dialysis and anti-depressants are not directly comparable.

Here is my personal story:

3 years back, I was prescribed to go on such 'feel-good' medication, when I was over-stressed due to work overload and many things going on in the life - leading to a near death experience.

Through out my work life (10+ years), having observed quite a few people around me, who have been 'on medication' - and further reading on side-effects of such medicines. I went to the root how these things work and why people are not able to get off them, and in many cases, it has worsened the situation.

**I took an intuitive (and calculated) decision to not take those medicines.** I fought through it, it took me 3 years  and few lucky coincidences (met the right people on the way). I went through hellish nights, mostly all by myself - all kind of crazy thoughts, weaknesses. (Not comparing with your situation, but I've even experienced Near Death feelings - more than once)

**But I did not take medicines and kept experimenting with diets and exercises**.

Further - prior to that, I was 'addicted' to taking Dispirin + Cetrizine (anti-histamines), whenever I'd sneeze even once.

Today, I have a better understanding of the world of 'addictive' and unhealthy medications.

And guess, what - **today I am not dependant on any medicine**, Not even Dispirin / anti-histamines. I can count on my fingers, that I only took some multivitamins and a fever medicine (less than 5 times) - in 3 years.

&#x200B;

So - sure, please do not take my advice as it is, because I do not know your full context and I do not have a medical degree.

But, do not assume that I do not know what I am talking about - or whether I am doing for internet Karma (As far as I recall, I have never downvoted anyone on reddit - either I upvote, or I pass).

My personal experience may not be relatable for you, but I have some first hand experience & knowledge and it is the mission of rest of my life to provide tools and platform for sustainable lifestyle for the future generation.

To add further: Well more than once (I do not want to brag the count) - **I have talked people out of depression and suicidal episode. Just by being there, lending them ear - in one case, as long as 1+ year. Sometimes, even when I was in low energy.**

**Since people like to hear this kinda emotional stuff - 4 years back, I even lost a friend who was very upbeat, but couldn't fight any more because of the 'root cause' of the modern depression.**

Thank you very much for your (and others) downvotes and **I sincerely wish the medications will ease your pain.**

Unfortunately, my scientific understanding has low confidence in that approach - which is what I shared.

Apologies for the tone of this post. **This anger is not towards you, but towards the root cause of this - anti-depressants - culture. Because, I know very well - it does not come from the right place, it is not sustainable for the upcoming future.**",1,7,1592224128.0,,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

fuschpo,If you can afford to take care of a dog (not leave it alone at home all the time..... Eg. If you have family or if you have wfh kind of work situation) you should look into therapy dogs. Or maybe get a dog like Weimaraner. They need high exercise and are always by your side (they suffer from separation anxiety if separated for too long).

fushixe,"Yes I get what you mean. I mentioned my experience and agreed with the OPs father that it helps because I have seen the change in how I used to struggle everyday and I want people to try just in case it helps them too. I agree it doesn’t work that way for everyone. If you don’t feel good, talk to a friend and please visit a doctor. It’s very hard to live with depression but it’s not impossible to get better even if it may seem that way if you would just ask for help.
