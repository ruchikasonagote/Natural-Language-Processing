Esp the second last one, where the ball deflected off an Indian player's stick, went out of play, but GB were awarded a penalty corner upon review. Today in the women's match even the commentator noted a couple of times that the referee was being a bit harsh on India.

(Edit: Note - this is similar for rugby, except minus immigrants - its reputation is posh people in Ireland, Unionists in Northern Ireland - yet this is a sport we're successful in)

Once every four years there's a world cup and Ireland somehow beats a team we really shouldn't (Pakistan, England and West Indies in that order) but sadly the number of participants was reduced and Ireland did not take part last time. 

Although we have been promoted to test status it just doesn't get exposure - the world cup would have been crucial to that. Some ODIs have been interesting, giving us coverage and experience, but we are not that successful.

Cricket has to compete with our indigenous sports of Gaelic Football and Hurling (which uses a stick and is fast paced, so comparisons have been made), our failing sport of soccer (poor local teams and leagues, don't retain talent, poor performances) and our only domestically successful professional sport rugby (ie. we produce and retain professional players while being competitive)

Out of that list it's closer to soccer - there may be a domestic league, I doubt it's professional as the interest level is too low, which in turn means we don't retain talent that we produce (eg. Eoin Morgan leaving to play in England and sadly for England). So even if we manage to be halfway successful in producing players, that's only half the battle.

Edit: The people I know who play cricket fall into the categories of either posh (Irish) or desi. By all accounts it's great fun to play and is seen as an enjoyable summer sport (off season) without the same level of fitness and dedication required as soccer/rugby/GAA (out of which only GAA plays in summer).

Out of team sports it probably is top 10 just by virtue of a limited number of team sports overall. When comparing sports I do not like comparing individual sports with team sports, equestrian versus rugby is a pointless comparison. 

In 2021 our national broadcaster released [some statistics](https://www.rte.ie/sport/other-sport/2021/0126/1192163-gaelic-games-remains-irelands-most-popular-sport/) for the Olympics, as for most popular sports (top six only) you'll see two things of note - one, the numbers decrease rapidly (so cricket will likely be in the 1-2% range) and second you'll see that Gaelic Games is an amalgamated number (in reality this is 3 sports, Gaelic Football, Hurling and Gaelic Handball - what's the breakdown per sport? Don't know)

Furthermore, it's difficult to calculate popularity by player numbers as soccer counts 5 aside players in their numbers and hurling and Gaelic football are aggregated into one number *again*. 

The other Irish poster here says cricket is less popular than *netball*, which considering 1.5% of Ireland's population is estimated to be South Asian (74,000) just makes this an impossibility in participation numbers alone. Amongst the Irish population, again, the sport has its hotspots.

The sport is on an upward trajectory with 25,000 children alone taking up cricket in 2018, bolstered with the adult Irish and immigrant community, this figure is higher in reality with the [Irish Times claiming 50,000](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/fitness/bowled-over-by-the-many-virtues-of-cricket-1.4031590). For a comparison, Rugby Union has a reported 150,000 players (2011) - again, soccer and GAA  are not easy to compare due to their skewed numbers (mentioned above). Anecdotally, my secondary school (primarily a rugby playing school) has re-introduced cricket in the last five years.

There are some interesting relationships in these numbers too that make it further difficult. For example, soccer may still have the largest participation regardless, and considered the most popular sport, but regularly international competitions rank lower on a list of anticipated events (eg. Euro 2020 was 4th, behind the Olympics (a novelty) and an *annual* international rugby competition, the 6 Nations). The most popular soccer on TV is the English Premier League as interest in the national team has plummeted, barely filling a stadium. In recent years national team matches have also dropped down the list of top watched sporting events. 

In regards to rugby, it's considered to be a more posh sport in Dublin (less so in Munster), in the 1990s it almost died out, but now it punches above its weight in viewing figures and match attendances despite having a lower participation rate than soccer and GAA. Primarily as a result of our better management of professionalism, allowing us to retain talent we develop in Ireland and are therefore competitive at club and international levels. 

So based off of those two paragraphs: Is rugby more popular because more people regularly watch Irish clubs compete (in low numbers) or is soccer more popular because 600k will watch Liverpool in a final? Is rugby more popular because 10k will attend a rugby match in a rainstorm in winter in Dublin, or is soccer more popular because every second person will talk to you about Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea and Spurs? Is rugby more popular because it fills out a stadium since every rugby match is a full test, or is soccer more popular because people don't attend friendlies but fill out the stadium for a qualifying match (showing support when it's important)? 

To answer the above questions: Ireland is a nation of sport lovers, when Ireland has an opportunity for success, we will support the team. Eg. Women's Hockey had an upset a few years ago, interest spiked - since then, interest has dropped. There are regular competitions where Ireland is competitive, such as rugby and horse racing - these are quite popular. If Ireland qualifies for an international soccer tournament (Euros), the nation will be behind them and you'll see viewership likely hit the number one spot on TV. If the Irish cricket team somehow beats India and is in a quarter final, you will see people watch that QF and interest in cricket peak - unless the team manages consistent performances and it's televised, this number will then drop again over time. 

In summary - by ranked popularity statistics available, it's quite low when compared with individual sports, but if individual sports are excluded and cricket is compared only witch team sports I would wager it is 5th or lowest 6th. In overall participation numbers, with 50,000 registered players, it's again likely around 5th or 6th. Both of these rankings would depend on GAA being split in to three sports. Note: Cricket is not on free to air TV in Ireland, this is a barrier to viewership statistics for an emerging sport. 

Success breeds new players and Ireland needs success in cricket, hopefully another upset soon at a world cup and one or two ODI series wins at home. Outside of this, the immigrant community is massively supporting the game and on the amateur level there is decent interest. We struggle to retain our players at our clubs, similar to soccer, opposite to rugby and hopefully those players who do leave to play in other leagues don't switch allegiance like Eoin Morgan. That way we may improve our competitiveness. 

**Last note:** It is quite obtuse of the other Irish poster here to claim cricket is not at all popular and would be behind Netball, when it boasts 50,000 players, 25,000 new youths playing as of 2019, 126 registered clubs across the island (which may be low, as Munster has 41 affiliated clubs at junior and senior level, I took 13 for those that participate in the Irish Senior Cup only), *four* international cricket grounds (and a fifth planned) with the largest capacity being 11,500.",1,6,1627992305.0,harblstuff,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

h7jqk2j,"No problem, happy to provide. Sadly it's just not as straight forward, but cricket in Ireland is in a better position than 2007, where we had only 7,000 registered amateur players. 

It all depends on what Cricket Ireland can do to capitalise on that success - with a robust system in place to capture new demand, translating in to new amateur players and potentially development of international players, then yeah it will be good. 

If Ireland can achieve consistent success off the back of this (even if it takes 3-4 years to develop it), then that is the true measure of success. 

If both of these fail to materialise, then it will be remembered like the 2007 upset of Pakistan - a great sporting fact that you can mention and people will be aware of. 

Note: Beating Pakistan helped cricket, but really it grew from the 2011 CWC - so it's never just *one* event that helps propel (any) sport forward, it's two or three. 

---------

I attended one of the ODIs against India after we got test status, the Malahide Cricket Grounds were packed out. Again, mostly Indians, but you're talking about increased gate receipts, awareness of the sport in the media and on the ground (even if that's only in Malahide), increased concessions (so the economy of opening food stalls, shirt sales at matches is more attractive) and more experience for our players.

I saw Virat Kohli go out early, thinking we had a chance - of course we didn't, but enjoyable nonetheless. 

Similar for our first test against Pakistan, our Pakistani community packed out the grounds alongside dedicated Irish fans. We weren't great, but the more tests we have the better and overall the awareness and economic attractiveness increases. 

One day we'll cause an upset and it will have a material impact, if we can do that once or twice more in the years following, then it can be captured and translated into greater player numbers and results.",1,8,1627995664.0,harblstuff,False,neutral,positive,positive,positive
