fw15lwi,"While I don't want to underplay their achievements, and the good work they did, I think it is worth pointing out that the battle to decriminalise homosexuality was a long one and fought by many lawyers, not all of whom had the political connections (SC Judge uncle, BJP spokesperson dad) as those mentioned in this article. 

Over the last few years I've seen the lawyers mentioned in this article give a lot of interviews in which you get the kind of clear impression that they single-handedly decriminalised homosexuality. But the reality is the struggle was lead by an organisation called Naz Foundation, directed by Anjali Gopalan, and represented by Anand Grover, at the Delhi High Court in 1991 - when neither of these lawyers were even parties to the case. The Alternative Law Forum in Bangalore did a lot of work to draft the petitions that ultimately led to this outcome. A boutique law firm in Delhi did drafting for these lawyers, and senior advocates like Ashok Desai (former AG) lead oral arguments for them in the case. The judgment itself acknowledges the contributions of many lawyers apart from these two.

A victory like this was a team effort and it would be nice to see the media acknowlege the less famous but no less important lawyers and activists (And the group of students!) who worked towards this. We have a tendency in India to make heroes out of anyone who is visible and good at PR (just look at our current political leadership). That is not always an accurate picture and often elides the good work done by people who aren't good at twitter.

Also, what I would like to see is a good outline of different arguments presented in the court pro/anti the law and what lead to legalizing homosexuality in our country. I bet that'd be a good read for many educated elders who still feel that it isn't natural or spew homophobia. Homophobia had long been normalized in our country. To counter this, it'd be nice if newspapers could be bold and present the arguments regarding homosexuality and LGBTQ+ and why they too deserve a normal life. My own parents seem to be very uncomfortable talking about the topic and I consider my parents to be pretty liberal and progressive in other aspects of life.

fw1phb5,"I think hoping for changes to happen democratically misunderstands what democracy is. 

Democracy by definition is the dictatorship of the majority. What the majority wants, it gets. That is a well functioning democracy. 

Now we also understand that the rights of minorities can get trampled this way. They might be screwed over because they don‚Äôt have power at the ballot box. So therefore we write a document that says ‚ÄúEVERYONE, regardless of who they are, have these rights‚Äù. And the courts will ensure that the majority can‚Äôt pass laws or engage in practices that violate the rights of the minorities. 

This is great for most people because a person can be in a minority sometimes but not at other times. You can be in the linguistic majority (Hindi), but in a sexual minority (gay). The Constitution should protect you when you need it and the ballot box gets you what you want otherwise.

And Courts can often help society change for the better. By stopping us from oppressing a minority, it helps us reevaluate what we‚Äôre doing. Worth looking at American history as an example. Marriage between blacks and whites was illegal in many states until 1967. That‚Äôs when the Supreme Court struck it down. When they did, acceptance for interracial marriage among the general population was 20%. With such low support, no politician was getting elected promising this. Fortunately the Court did the right thing despite it not being popular. And gradually, the bigots died off. Younger people grew up with the right ideas about this. Today acceptance for interracial marriage is higher than 90%.

fw134si,"Think of this way - lawyers have to go court, prepare the legal arguments, draft the papers, argue the case, deal with the client's anxieties. Not everyone can handle it. As a result in Delhi you have the rise of the middleman lawyer. The job of the middleman lawyer is to do none of the above, but only to flog the case in the media. This becomes increasingly important because judges, especially SC judges, are increasingly responsive to the media - so a good public narrative that grabs headlines will obviously help your chances in court.  

That's what we have here. The middleman lawyer will pull in a senior advocate to argue the case  - in most of the 377 matters, it was people like Ashok Desai (former AG) who was brought in by one of these lawyers. It was him who actually did the work of convincing the judges. The arguments he used were prepared by the team you mentioned. That team was hired by the middleman lawyers. The job of the middleman was to co-ordinate between these two. 

Being the middleman requires charisma and connections. e.g. one of the two lawyers mentioned in this article is the daughter of a former BJP spokesperson who now heads a Delhi think tank. Another is the niece of a former SC judge. The work they do doesn't require legal skills. That's how they were able to take credit for the case while actually spending the bulk of the duration abroad (I believe one of them actually started and finished an LL.M. in an American university during the case - something that could only be possible if someone else was going to court, meeting with the registrar, getting adjournments, etc.). 

But for the general population they don't want a team of hardworking anonymous people to lead a movement - they want a charismatic leader who spent an entire year doing magazine interviews and giving speeches, while somebody else does the boring drafting, filing, etc. If you ask around the legal community in Delhi, you'll learn this for yourself. 

The reality is - and everyone knows - that the Naz case was litigated for years at the Delhi HC by a team lead by Anand Grover. These lawyers were not even part of the original case. They joined in the final stages by intervention applications and are now taking credit for the result. In cases like this it is hard to bear a grudge because the outcome is fantastic.

fw1pisg,"It's more than just superstitious thinking, the way Indians, especially Hindus, view homosexuality, and sexuality in general, has been significantly shaped by the activities of Protestant missionaries in India during the 19th century. Their activities and reform movements, which were originally aimed towards converting the masses to Protestantism, mostly failed but there's something else which happened instead - the transfer of Protestant ideas into Hinduism and to a lesser extent, Islam. 

As Hinduism borrowed Christian modes of thinking, many Hindus began to reject certain aspects of their own religion - the Kamasutra, the engravings of beautiful girls with naked breasts displayed on temple walls, the outward expressions of sexuality, homosexuality, transgenderism, etc. This gave rise to a new breed of Hindus who had a certain loathing of sexuality and extreme views on decency, sanskara (manners) and marriage. Most Hindus today aren't even aware that their ideas on homosexuality actually come from 19th century Protestant theology; they think these are ancient Hindu ideas, which I find amusing.",24,5,1593164502.0,cestabhi,1593173439.0,negative,neutral,negative,negative

> The RSS showed support after 377 was scrapped, it's the same as corporations that discriminated against women

Except that unlike the corporations who are legally bound to clamp down on sexual harassment, the RSS has no need to show any support. They've not shown support for the Sabarimala judgment for instance. Again, this does not make the RSS a progressive body or that they're doing a favor. What it does mean is that I think this isn't something that they are very adamant about.
