I think it was called ""Anandi Gopal"" on DD ,and had a opening credits song along the same lines...
Did Girish Karnad play her husband?

I'm foggy on the details but I remember they get married via standard arranged marriage and then he hates her guts because he had no say in choosing her, she was uneducated, was docile and did her MIL's bidding etc. He then proceeds to teach her (against everyone's wishes and even her protests), gradually develops mutual respect and love,and then when she gets accepted in an American Medical school he forces her to go even when she's reluctant to cross the ocean and leave het family behind. Her life there is documented in the letters she writes him, the latter ones about how the cold has weakened her and then she passes away I guess.

drtr8wd,"**Rukhmabai**

Rukhmabai (22 November 1864 - 25 September 1955) was an Indian physician and feminist. She is best known for being one of the first practicing women doctors in colonial India as well as being involved in a landmark legal case involving her marriage as a child bride between 1884 and 1888. The case raised significant public debate across several topics, which most prominently included law vs tradition, social reform vs conservatism and feminism in both British-ruled India and England. This ultimately contributed to the Age of Consent Act in 1891.
