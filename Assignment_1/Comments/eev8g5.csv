The Friendship Highway (also known as the China-Nepal Highway, Chinese: 中尼公路; pinyin: Zhongni Gonglu) is an 800-kilometre (500 mi) scenic route connecting the capital of Tibet, Lhasa, with the Chinese/Nepalese border at the Sino-Nepal Friendship Bridge between Zhangmu and Kodari.  It includes the westernmost part of China National Highway 318 (Shanghai-Zhangmu) and crosses three passes over 5,000 m (16,400 ft) before dropping to 1,750 m (5,700 ft) at the border.

The 2015 earthquakes in the region closed the highway and caused many evacuations. By 2016 there were some repairs but trading on the route was not restored to pre-quake levels.From Lhasa, the Friendship Highway follows the Kyi Chu river for about 60 km (40 mi) up to the confluence with the Yarlung Tsangpo River (Brahmaputra) at Chushul.

fbxzfg9,"Since you insist on source, I shall attempt to provide you with it. The person in question is not an Indian citizen. Under Art. 19, the right to protest or assemble (as the language says) is available only to the ‘citizens’ of the country. In order to see the difference, one may direct the eyes to the wording of Art. 21, which uses the word ‘persons’ instead of ‘citizens’. This is relevant because many of the rights that we call as Fundamental Rights are not simply available to all persons — they’re only available to the citizens of the country. There are absolutely no restrictions at all on the powers of the Parliament to make laws on matters not circumscribed by the Constitution — the Parliament has the constitutional competence to enact laws to the effect.

Pursuant to this stands enacted the Foreigners Act, 1936. Under s. 3(2) of the said statute, a foreigner is bound by several limitations — including those fundamental to his autonomy that would plainly be unconstitutional if it had been a citizen. Under s. 3(2)(c) - s. 3(2)(g) a foreigners clearly doesn’t have as many rights as Indian — he can even be arrested, detained and/confined by an order of the Central Government pursuant to the powers vested with it under s. 3(1). In particular, s. 3(2)(e)(vi) and s. 3(2)(e)(vii) probity a person from associating with certain persons or engaging in certain activities. Students visas are usually issued with prohibiting political activity — the legal sanctity is derived from the foregoing provisions. Violations of these conditions, even though it may not be a violation of the statutory law, is a ground for deportation. The law is almost the same everywhere in the world — because governments are suspicious of foreign political actors.

It’s political activity to participate in a protest. It needn’t be organised by a political party to be deemed political — at this rate, you’d claim voting NOTA is not political because it’s not a vote for any party. Don’t be absurd by conflating elections and political parties alone to be the constituent chunk of political activity. It’s not only stupid, but whittles down the vibrancy of political activity and democracy. 

I’m not sure how you can assert no laws were broken, or conditions not complied with when I have clearly stated the provisions of the law — including the specific sections.

I do not know why you thought it was relevant to cite it at all. 

While there is law on the subject, the very fact that certain rights are not available to non-citizens means exactly that: they cannot insist on due process as much as a citizen. The scope of Art. 21 is far narrow for a non-citizen than a citizen. In order to understand this, all you have to read is AK Gopalan case where the Supreme Court held that the mere existence of a ‘procedure established by law’ is sufficient to deprive the life or liberty of an individual. The due process was read in much later, and operates in the context of other rights.
