Will your parents happily give you blessings if you marry a SC/ST/OBC person?

Until these types of questions stay relevant, we can't see the end of reservation system. Acceptance of people regardless of their cast in every field and roles in society in necessary. 

There are some people in a tier 1 city like Mumbai too who silently follow cast practices, like using old and different utensils when giving food to maids, making them sit on floor and some going to the extent of asking what cast they belong to when hiring a cook. 

Instead of promoting intercast and inter-religious marriages we are regressing back to old practices using modern means. Matrimonial websites/apps also promote castism openly. Why not just completely remove cast as an identity from these websites?

On the reservation part, I myself had lost my seat to a reserved candidate when I tried to take admission in a top engineering college in Mumbai. My mom and dad had tears in their eyes  and I had anger against reservation.

We are still in the process of witnessing this elite capture happen so, it‚Äôs not complete yet, many reservation candidates are still those who deserve to benefit from affirmative action. But the day is not far that the elite capture will be complete.

What would be interesting to see is what happens after that and who gets blamed for it. Till that time, the status quo can continue.

They haven't seen it and they definitely do not follow what's happening in spheres out of their sight.

It doesn't matter if your parents don't have money for your education, they can always use their Brahmin card to get a loan which you can easily repay, because let's be honest; you'll easily get a high paying job just because you are a Brahmin.

Lower caste life is altogether a different thing. Doesn't matter how rich your family is. You are still oppressed, by everyone around you. You want to go stay at a fancy place? You can't, because lower caste people aren't allowed to stay at the Ritz. So what if your dad gifted you a BMV on your 18th birthday? And what if your father has an extremely good paying job because he used reservation to get into a good college to give you a good life? You'll still have to end up in one of the good colleges of India even with passing marks, but you'll have to keep your face down every fucking time because your ancestors were oppressed.

jdqhr98,"What is your basis for saying reservation is not working?

In my area in Kerala, this is the change I witnessed in 70 years:

The area is 3km sq. And has maybe 30%+ dalit population due to land reforms from 1960s.

Land reform:

Land from local brahmin zamindar was taken over by communist government in 1970s. The zamindar was allowed to keep 500 acres, the rest was taken over and split up to rest of the population - christian, obc, dalits.

Dalits got smallest pieces, typically 20-30 cents per family of 10 people etc. Whereas christians, Nairs, obc etc would have got 50 cents to 5-10 acres.

Bonded labor: 
(Reason why India ranks highest in modern slaves)

This land reform freed the Kerala dalits from bonded labor or slavery - having to work for their landlord in return for subsistence amount of food.

They are not allowed to go elsewhere for jobs.

They were not entitled to market wages. There is no money in wages. Just some grain they get daily after work that's barely enough for dinner.

They needed to be hungry in the morning so that they will be submissive and will not run away. This is why dalits did not run away to mumbai and find work. They have no money at hand. They have no extra food tired than for the next meal.

That way they come to work and wait for some food from the zamindar the next morning.

The food was given in leaves. The leaves were placed in small pits on the ground, in the yard of the local upper caste nair or christian zamindar who has sublet parcels of land from the brahmin family.

1960s: the communist government tried to do land reform. The government was not allowed to do it and were dismissed by the Indian Government President due to pressure from US government, Catholic Church, and Upper Caste land owners.

(they'd I this to reduce competition for other dalit students)  this will increase the competetion for general students even more. It is much better for general students that dalit student apply in reserved catogy in this case, don't you think so?

Are they really saying that only 3.4L SC/STs would be considered creamy layered? Are they including non-government SC/STs in this report? Lastly, reservations mean only that, *reserved seats*, the institute/department can't force SC/STs to apply for the reserved seats! There aren't enough SC/STs applying for many of these reserved posts, so clearly there is a huge problem that needs to be addressed before these folks enter the job market. 

One thing is clear, however, we desperately need to see the caste census reports and see how well reservation is currently working (we can't keep running a broken clock). SC/ST is not a monolith, there are thousands of communities within this category, maybe some communities are doing good and some aren't.

But today there are people who are dalits but have affluent lifestyle and they are the ones taking the seat away from both the intellectual kids and the poor dalit people for whom they were supposed to be given.

Reservations are fundamentally detrimental for killing merits of general lemme give you can example suppose a SC student scores top 50 rank in some big exam he can choose any clg he wants hr chooses the best one with 60 general seats and 8 SC seat.

Case 1- He applies via general category he gets the seat so now the 9th rank SC guy gets a seat there since 1st rank SC guy didnt choose to use his reservation.
But since he choose general the 61st general guy wont get a seat there since SC guy took it in general.

Case 2- he applies via SC category he gets the seat now the 9th SC category person doesnt get the seat but the 61st general category gets the seat since one seat remains empty in top 60.

If you look at any exam data you will find general seat equivalent people to be more intellectual in thay paper than the reserved counterparts so losses are minimal when the guy takes reservation.

But the bigotry wont stop even if we modify the reservation system. Because that bigotry is there in us because of our religious beliefs. To change these beliefs we need to modify our religious texts just like we need to modify our constitution according to the changing times.   


Why can't the religious systems be modified? We can make changes in constitution and laws but why can't we make changes to religious texts written thousands of years ago?  


In an ideal democracy there should not have been any interference of religion with the state. But here we are actually electing people who represent their religions first and then their constituencies.

My point is that even if a reservation category guy becomes the richest man in the world, there will be upper caste people who discriminate against him just on the basis of their caste.. That is why I asked the guy if he would be willing to marry a relative off to the reservation category family, so that their son can also enjoy the  same benefits.. I am  pretty sure a majority of upper caste people who moan about rich SC guys will never even think of joining their ""rich"" family, which clearly shows why reservation should be caste based and not based on income or wealth..",7,5,1679844384.0,blackbeltkunjappu,False,negative,neutral,neutral,neutral

> caste system affects a poor brahmin as well  

Nope, poverty is what malaises them, not caste system. A poor brahmin is not stopped from entering temples, not stopped from using the village well. Caste is not an impediment but poor economic status is. 

Caste discrimination hits the poor in the hardest way, this is true. Because they don't have means to live an adequate life. But you are projecting that all poor are discriminated based on caste? That is where you are mixing them up. 

For poverty, there is free foodgrains, subsidised healthcare and free education‚Äînot based on caste. It is for every poor in the country. Reservation is to reduce the caste discrimination and that's why the basis is caste. Because the oppression has roots in caste and not economic status. Even middle class lower castes are discriminated in daily life. Disagree, unaware?

My point simply from the very start is that you can NOT say that brahmins Or other upper castes members don't do sanitation or work with what lower caste members of society are generalized with. As it it harmful to them and their situation. They don't have governmental support and thus don't have the means to come out of their situation either, esp in the big cities. So undermining or outright declining their profession and situation simply based on the label they're born with is the very definition of discrimination.
