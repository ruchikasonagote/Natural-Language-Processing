iohsh1u,"Byju could have handled it in a sane manner.. They didn't. They wanted to teach him a lesson. But it was a foolish plan. There was no Wolf Gupta. There was no 1cr package for a pre-teen. Poonia handled it really well. Used social media effectively to expose how corporates arm-twist people. They realized too late how much of a bad press all this gave them and withdrew the suit. Now, any person who uses social media often knows how shitty byjus is, how their predatory marketing tactics can cause financial ruin. No amount of publicity by sponsoring ICT or by hiring actors like SRK and Hrithik can help them recover this slump unless they do something genuinely good. Hope their further focus is on the product and not on aggressive marketing but I genuinely am very happy that its not doing well.",2072,0,1663218223.0,razdaman92,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

ioidnox,"I did a teaching stint at whitehat during the pandemic and here is my experience.

When you're teaching children, I believe it's a huge responsibility you're taking on. A lot of the teachers didn't have a technology background. Honestly, I'm not a programming snob, and I don't think that a technology background is necessary to learn programming these days. However, when it comes to teaching others you just \*have\* to know your basics. Whitehat didn't really care whether the teachers knew the basics of computer programming or not. They only cared whether a teacher could parrot out the pre-defined lesson plan. If a child asked anything outside of the lesson plan the teacher would deflect and say she would explain in the next class, or ask the student to focus on what is part of the lesson.  I also don't put the blame on the teachers because hell knows I'd do anything in my power to keep my family afloat during the pandemic. But whitehat knew what they were doing right off the bat.

When Pradeep Poonia's posts started gaining traction, and the infamous video of teachers unable to explain ""cloud computing"" and ""difference between java and javascript"" surfaced, the technology team quickly put together this learning platform for teachers that was basically a bunch of youtube videos followed by multiple choice questions which was compulsory for the teachers to go through. Obviously the cheatsheet for the answers was widely shared on the teachers whatsapp groups and did nothing to really educate the teachers. Again I don't blame the teachers because it was a pretty comprehensive learning plan expecting teachers to learn everything from the binary number system to Saas within a week(!)

Lastly, because there was no privacy protection or any checks built in to filter who can apply for a free class, many women got flashed by perverts and management did nothing to protect women having to see men expose their dicks to them on their platform except for saying, ""please turn on your camera only after the child turns on their camera"".

At the end of each free introductory session you had to spend 10 minutes pitching to the parents on why they should invest in opting for whitehat classes and close the call with ""our guidance counsellor will call to discuss with your further"". The ""guidance counsellors"" were nothing but the sales team with no knowledge of technology or how it was going to be helpful. 

To summarise, the whole operation was built on deception. On one hand there were whitehat ads soliciting individuals for teaching jobs saying ""you don't need a computer science degree to teach programming"", and on the other hand, ads targeting parents saying we have teachers from IIT and IIM teaching your children. 

Needless to say, I didn't stick around for long.",49,0,1663234988.0,hungry_lizard_00,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral

ioi6qun,"Investors who have no clue how teaching happens have ruined the ed-tech landscape. If you look closely at the recent retrenchments at Unacademy it included some teachers who were actually quite well known in JEE circles as remarkably good. But as per Unacademy's metrics which related to number of views rather than quality of content they didnt make the mark. 

Many of these ed-tech companies are chasing some wild gooeses in the form of razmatazz visuals, and now AI whereas they should have been looking to go back to basics in training teachers in good content and basic presentation skills.

ioj8jp5,"When it comes to subscription revenue, Econ 101 students are clearly told that subscription revenue is to be recognised as the service/product is supplied (over the time). All this time Byju's were recognising the whole revenue immediately as the sale was made.

They are still trying to hide the unpaid loans (which their crook sales sold-under pressure). A lot of parents, being tricked into getting the loans, defaulted.
