#A ""protest toolkit"" is something which protesters have been using worldwide for Black Lives Matter & Climate Change Protest etc. A toolkit's main aim is to enable anyone unfamiliar with the ""cause"" (in this case, ongoing farmers' protest in India) to better understand the situation and make decisions on how to support the ""cause"" based on their own analysis. In some cases it also shows you protest venues & timing etc. It comprises of basic information of any issue, what to tweet, what hashtags to use, which politicians, journalists and activists to tag on social media etc. MOST IMPORTANTLY: You can't ""leak"" a Protest Toolkit because it is available for everyone to see online in public domain.

Activists are crucial agents in highlighting global or national issues and turning heads of world's governments and corporates that results in some positive displacement towards mitigation and adaptation initiatives. 

Also, these activists when they are taking break from climate activism, they try to re-establish freedom of speech in countries throught their active channels of social media and google documents. Because there are no Global agencies that these activists can approach to or highlight their issues with such governments using diplomatic channels of their own countries. 

United Nations, International court of justice, G20 , SAARC and other similar collective platforms are useless. The only way to put a point across is writing a Google document that is publicly available for editing so that anyone can write their ideas because all people in the world have good intentions when the document is coming from Greta Thunberg and other activists, *how dare it be bad?*

All governments must rescind to these *new and efficient ways* of information sharing among international channels of protestors and work towards marking existing international jury forums as redundant.

This was tweeted by P C Mohan -- 3rd Term BJP Lok Sabha MP-Bengaluru Central, Member of Parliamentary Committees on External Affairs & Urban Development, 2-Time MLA

https://twitter.com/PCMohanMP/status/1360936928107929601

Am I the only one here that does not find this tweet objectionable? The logic here is flawless. If Kasab's age was not a defense, neither should it be for Disha Ravi.

She is not being 'compared to' Kasab. This is a specific rebuttal to the use of her age in her defence. I really do not see the error here?

There are two possible responses to this—qualify why in her specific case her age is a defense(""she went to college from 17-21, a period of extended childhood/infantilisation beyond the age of legal majority, a period of time Kasab spent getting radicalised instead so his true adulthood started much sooner that Disha's"") or stop using her age as a defense/plea for mercy(which should not IMO automatically accept guilt), because there are some very young people out there that have committed some very heinous crimes, and continue using the other arguments in her favour.

I am not too convinced by the former argument but that's just something I made up right now; possibly there are better arguments out there.

Nevertheless, it's absurd to suggest that she's getting compared to Kasab just because their ages(at the time of arrest) match. It would not have come up at all if the age defense did not get so popular. To me it's a *reductio ad absurdum* of sorts, which done properly(as I feel it is in this case), is a legitimate argumentation technique.",8,0,1613385204.0,shahofblah,1613385420.0,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral

There's no benefits in them for the traders who've been looting farmers, though. - I've also confirmed this from farmers who're otherwise supporters of Sharad Pawar NCP too.

**Moderation**: On the one hand, Twitter wants to be seen as a platform that encourages free speech but on the other hand, they are losing out to the sheer number of troll bots and alt-accounts that any number of people can create. It's a problem of scale that they think can be solved with AI. I don't see how this is possible in the near-term given that the AI has to be trained on a subset of data that is continually being gamed and held to differing standards.


**Lack of intent**: Given that a tweet can only have a maximum of 280 characters, it isn't easy to communicate complex ideas or views within that limit. Sure, people can create threads of tweets, but their followers just read the initial tweet and assume immediate intent.


**Manufactured outrage**: Given the 280 character limit imposed on a tweet, it is a lot easier for someone to garner attention by blurbing or retweeting something nonsensical with an obvious intent to get others ""fired up"".

gnktn08,"This is not just happening in India. The same things are going on everywhere in the world. The world as we know is getting more and more divided. Partially due to  availability of internet and forums like reddit/twitter/FB. Twitter is not the only place where radical right/left wing ideas are being propagated. For example, if some hardcore BJP supporter reads this thread the he/she would think Reddit is a toxic place where people are out there to suppress their ideas and identities. We humans were always divided but we just did not have a way to know what some random stranger from a different city is thinking. How many of us have hardcore right/left wing/leaning parents/kids or grandparents/grandkids?  If we can't seem to convince our own family members or friends about a political ideology then what makes us think that we can do that over internet to some random stranger? People with similar ideas flock together and that is exactly what is happening on twitter and here in this particular discussion. We tend to think that everyone else is a villain but the truth is far from it.  We never stop to think why Modi is revered so much? Why did BJP, despite its authoritarian policies, got a huge mandate? Why did Trump get almost 50% votes in 2020? It is not all bots or IT cells that do the work. Its not bots that voted in previous election. There is a real reason why people are tolerating these policies. Why does Hindutva resonate with such huge percent of population? Without digging into these reasons we can never solve the issues. We can keep dissing on the other side but that would generate more hatred. Know that the other side despises you as much as you despise them. Only solution for this is to have a centrist view and know the real problem. How many of you have actually completely read or understood the farm laws? I bet none of us (including me). 

I don't have a solution for this other than asking people to listen to each other.  Sometimes the other side does not make any sense but still listen. Be a bigger person. Sometimes we can't change someone else's mind just like they can't change ours. If we keep taking we will eventually reach the root cause of this radicalization. If people change, governments will change. If ""Hindutva"" won't bring votes then politicians will stop using it as an agenda. If minority appeasement won't bring votes then politicians will stop using minorities as pawns.

Subsidized power for farming depleting the water table in Punjab? She is a ""climate activist"", isn't she? Doesn't it go against everything she stands for? 

""In its first report, the Group of Experts (GoE) set up to come out with a strategy for Punjab’s economic revival has called free farm power a major burden on the state’s finances, while urging government to pursue a switch to solar pumps and Direct Benefit Transfer electricity scheme in over-exploited blocks.

Withdrawal of subsidy is a major political issue for any government in the state with farmers being a prominent vote bank. All opposition parties play to the gallery and oppose any move in that direction by incumbent governments.""

""The GoE further states that the policy has very damaging environmental consequences as it encouraged farmers to opt for water-guzzling paddy crop more and more. This leads to excessive use of ground water resulting in an “alarming” fall in water table. “Finally, the policy is highly regressive since most of the subsidy accrues to larger farmers,” the report says.""

It involves planning. And you believe that Greta is a Terrorist? She is a public activist who opposes power. Maybe it's a foolish stance. Maybe she is just a public figure and people are using her. That doesn't constitute terrorism.

My main issue here is I can't trust that the government or police is doing due diligence. They have motive to paint anyone as terrorists. I don't trust them much regarding Farm laws which were rushed through in parliament without debate. What am I to believe here?

 I actually don't see the whole Pro Khalistani PJF a reason to arrest Disha. She collaborated with the PJF (who work to create *awareness* about human rights and social justice issues), which I doubt was because she wanted to work with a Pro Khalistani group (they bring *awareness* to multiple subjects, not just Khalistan), and more because they also create *awareness* on human rights, and have recently worked to bring *awareness* to farmer's rights.


**Me-**

Forgive me but the way you have used **awareness** (four times) in the same paragraph to defend the Pro Khalistani PJF, you yourself sound like an Pro Khalistani PJF sympathizer/ supporter. Even though you deny this later in the same comment above (ill get to that soon), i find it hard to believe that you will accept anything i say against them. But this is what i have to say- I believe the Pro Khalistani PJF (You have yourself used these words together several times now, what is google to make of this?) were responsible for sponsoring Disha Ravi and several others to do this- 

(Quoting Prem Nath, Joint Commissioner of Police, Cyber Cell of Delhi Police here) - 

""On 4th February, we came across a Google document toolkit on social media. We found it was created by pro-Khalistan group, the Poetic Justice Foundation. One portion of it mentioned the action points and named prior actions - digital strike through hashtags on 26 January, tweetstorm 23 January onwards, and physical action on 26 January. The second part of the document mentioned disruption of Indian cultural heritage and targeting of Indian embassies in various capitals,” the police said.

The police official said the points mentioned in the toolkit and physical developments witnessed in Delhi clearly point out that the toolkit action plan was executed on the ground in a copycat manner.""


**You-**

I don't get how her creating this toolkit somehow aids the Pro Khalistani movement. If anyone is to be blamed for somehow destabilising the country, shouldn't it be the PJF? Not some random girl who worked with them? It's not like what she was doing was Pro Khalistani, just the people she worked with.


**Me- (and also common sense) -**

Do you realize how weird what you said above sounds? Its like saying ""Don't blame the random person who **worked with** the ISI or ISIS to plan and disseminate information about organising a riot"". So what if the whatsapp group she created (and then deleted, which itself has legal repercussions) to organize the attack on Red Fort on Republic Day ? She was just **working with** them to facilitate the hooliganism on a heritage monument in the national capital, she isn't guilty at all. Smh


**You-**

And even then, freedom of expression is a constitutional right. Even if you're working with people who have Khalistani views, is that grounds for arrest? Can you actually legally be arrested (and I'm not saying I support the Khalistani movement) for being Khalistani?

*Me-**

Yes you can get arrested for spreading the propaganda of a banned anti national khalistani group like the SFJ. Warrants have already been issued for the other conspirators but they are absconding. Several people have been arrested by the NIA over the years and its is perfectly legal. Khalistanis are a terrorist group who want a separate nation of their own. Anyone found colluding or collabotating with them will get arrested sooner or later. Also you deny that you dont support them, but you had vehemently tried to portray them as an **""Awareness""** group when you started this debate. That sounded like support to me.


**You-**

And if I'm understanding this correctly, the toolkit was released first, and then the govt investigated who made it. Only after did they realize it was the PJF right (contradict me if I'm wrong)? So, the Khalistani thing wasn't even the base for investigation, more of something they just found along the way.

**Me**

It is only **after** a cyber crime has been committed that the police start investigating it. If they knew beforehand, they would just prevent the crime from happening? In this case, once they had hard, digital evidence of her collaborating with a pro khalistani group and for being the admin of the whatsapp group that asked the farmers to instigate violence and climb atop the red fort , the police had enough evidence and reason to arrest her for further questioning. It doesn't matter if the khalistani thing was a base for this investigation or not, even inciting people to Raid the Red Fort on 26th January is enough to arrest her for questioning. This is all perfectly legal, which is why it is happening.

3. If you know how search engines work, then you would know that Khalistan coming up when you search PJF is because of the numerous news articles and post that came out due to the government calling PJF Pro Khalistan (which again, I'm not saying they are not Pro Khalistan). That's what happens when terms are interlinked, when you search one the other shows up. For example, if you search reddit on google right now, most of the news articles that show up are in relation to investments. Is reddit an investment platform? No. But these articles show up because of reddit's recent popularity due to wallstreetbets and GME, which is popular right now, hence they show up. If I searched reddit 2 months ago, nothing related to investment would show up. When the same thing happens to something less popular like PJF (which right now is only popular due to this incident), then due to hundreds of websites, post and comments (like yours) containing the word PJF and Khalistan together, then when you search for PJF you get Pro Khalistan. If Pro Khalistan came up when I searched it 2 months ago, then yes I would be more inclined to agree with you, but the simple fact is, we can never know.

2. Delhi police could not establish that her actions resulted in red fort violence

""On 4th February, we came across a Google document toolkit on social media. We found it was created by pro-Khalistan group, the Poetic Justice Foundation. One portion of it mentioned the action points and named prior actions - digital strike through hashtags on 26 January, tweetstorm 23 January onwards, and `**physical action on 26 January. The second part of the document mentioned disruption of Indian cultural heritage**` and targeting of Indian embassies in various capitals,” the police said.

The police official said the points mentioned in the toolkit and physical developments witnessed in Delhi clearly point out that the toolkit action plan was executed on the ground in a copycat manner.""

Just making you aware that there are some issues in his statistics. So, verify what you watch. Didn't expect that you will be offended so quickly. Calm down.

>The bill introduced are better than existing system and I'll still say that these bills don't deserve the hate they are receiving.

Let's agree to disagree.

>People will support the Wire and The print whenever it speaks against the government, and when the opposite happens, suddenly it's all bullshit.

You are indulging in whataboutery now. I didn't say that The Wire is good or The Print is bad. Find the line in my comment, where I was comparing the two websites.

For me, the writer of the article or the opinion piece (op-ed) matters the most, plus secondary research to verify the authenticity of some of the claims made in an article. 

Using the same logic, there were people who earlier called The Print leftist, but are suddenly loving it, after reading pro-government articles. Both sides make the same mistake.",2,2,1615019864.0,,False,negative,neutral,negative,negative

They have already made presentations and had presented a 39 point PPT to the government on December 3. 

Before the protests reached Delhi, there were 2 meeting that had already been held. In the first meeting, the leaders went all the way to Delhi, but the Minister refused to meet (after earlier promising them). 

Then, the Secretary showed them a presentation and told them to accept the bills ""as it is"". The leaders got angry, teared the copies of the bills and walked out. The second meeting had a Minister attending the meeting, but it was the same result. It was only after the protests reached Delhi, that the Ministers started considering amendments. 

Everyone in this country wants reforms (including the farm leaders). But the reforms are not good. Read my original comment again, where I have talked about the Swaminathan Commission. The farm leaders have made it clear that they wanted proper implementation of the commission's proposed changes, but the government ignored most points (except few) for the new bill.",1,3,1615020432.0,,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral
