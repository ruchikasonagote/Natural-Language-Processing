hmwaq33,"I remember in the mid '90s there was a report aired on some tv channel on the attitude towards women in Hindi movies.

it called out various movies, but the only one I remember was the theme of harassment in the Aamir Khan-Madhuri Dixit starrer Dil. about this air of the enterprising hero who would impose himself on the women in the guise of pranks.

now, I was far more ignorant back then than I am now, and I remember wondering why would anyone even prepare something like that? and what was the point of it all? if the f-word was part of my vocabulary, I might have even said, ""wtf is this?"". I mean, I really liked Dil and I was a fan of the non-King Khan. I just thought the foundation that the report laid was a whole load of sensationalist rubbish.

but, over the years, that report has lingered. and festered in my mind. it would keep gnawing away until, slowly and without realising when, everything that report said made sense. we have been perpetuating an environment in our popular media where the harassment of women is seen as acceptable; even desirable. why is there even an argument about this?

a few things strike me from that report as relevant for this story in the OP. one, ignorance transcends all social layers. secondly, it takes years and years for a person to understand the conditioning cues that are present in the environment, let alone act against them.

lastly, more reporting like that is required. that these men have a mindset such as displayed in the OP is not the problem - that's just the symptom.

the problem is that we don't have anybody, today, taking steps to show that such a backward mindset being broadcasted as normal has harmful consequences.",47,0,1638422018.0,,False,neutral,negative,negative,negative

hmwaabx,"Ugh I hate this ‚Äúsanskaari‚Äù attitude that looks down on women for wearing skirts and western clothes because they‚Äôre revealing. 

Before colonisation and in ancient India, the outfits worn by Indians were very different. Women wore drapes (saree and other styles of drapes) without any blouses. Their breasts were bare and just covered by a pallu. It was very common. 

In the 16th century, during the Mughal period, Hindu women even wore breast jewellery that enhanced their chests. Look at Mughal paintings where women had so much cleavage and sometimes even transparent cholis that covered only half the breast. 

When the British invaded during around the Victorian era, there were still communities where women bared their breasts. Our ancestors dressed for the weather after all. So the Brits were appalled by the ‚Äúsavage way‚Äù of dressing and tried to introduce modesty and made women cover their breasts. Blouse and petticoat are both English words and both are a part of today‚Äôs saree. 

I know a lot of people are not interested in fashion or it‚Äôs history, but at this point, things like this should be taught to everyone in school because clearly it‚Äôs vital to know how what was considered sanskaari and how indian culture  progressed and regressed.",24,0,1638421773.0,Head2Heels,False,negative,negative,neutral,negative

1) Women stay at home :- yes

2)Women dont wear short clothes :- yes 

3)Women dont have rights :- yes  


Did rapes stop? I dont think so

ps. I dont get excited by women wearing short clothes. Rapes existed before also(I dont think these people know any history of any place or culture) people can get excited by any kind of clothing, self control should exist.

Also considering their model on women staying at home, then when male members go to work technically homes are unguarded(cause women will not be educated or have experience ), then in order to remove that unsafety women need to be educated on various topics, which in turn will require them to be taught. Considering that women stayed at home, females teachers will not exist cause they were never taught, so how can they teach. This will require males to teach and this will not help. In the end both genders will be mixed in society, in their model the safety of women is decreased. As for short clothing women are not wearing bikinis or sex suits in public,,they have common sense bruh. Besides by their logic men can wear anything(wait until homosexuality increases. its not wrong to say males will start to rape males, which i think already happens).Plus i dont think that guy who said rape is by consent even knows how rape works.
