fsfeqw3,"Traders and their Unions are the ones who have been pushing for Chinese product boycott for years since it hurts their business because they can't compete with Chinese cheap products ranging from diwali lights to those tiny god figurines to even freaking Agarbathis now. 

And since even lobbying the Govt isn't working because Govt knows boycott is stupid since not only might that entail WTO case lasting years but these cheap items sell because a broad section of Indians are buying them because its making their lives better than would otherwise be and third Indian trade is trivial from Chinese trade pie but Chinese trade is much bigger from Indian trade pie meaning retaliation may come from China which is currently unknown and Govt barely has a plan for that or any leverage because in reality, India-China trade isn't really what it could be. 

We need more trade with China to balance against them otherwise it will become like US-Soviets and India-Pakistan because both sides end up with the same conclusion when things get tough, i.e. *Who gives a crap, it doesn't really affect us, so go ahead do this XYZ stupid thing something decided we should do.*

Similar things happened in early to mid 2010s when e-com sites in India were giving those massive discount coupons and every 3rd month there would be some sort of Sale Bonanza and different Traders bodies would cause drama and write to Govt about how its illegal and undercutting the market and so on. 

Then there is the fact that Traders Unions in India do have power, sometimes official and sometimes underhanded. This is apparent in the APMC farmer-agri sector and the role of middle-men. 

Now agri produce sector isn't linked to China issue that much but the pattern is similar because its operating on a similar layer in India just linked to things which are connected to China and imports from there. It just so happens these traders can't control the input from China like they do in many other sectors in India (like agri) so they feel a loss of power and combine that with loss of revenue & greater profit and it is natural to see why they would be pissed and demand tariff hikes or bans on Chinese imports and since Govt won't do that, use Boycott calls often with Govt its ruling parties and their affiliates approvals.",2,3,1591014275.0,iVarun,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral
fsj8tsg,"> It's not opening it's pharma and IT services sectors for us.

Its true China has restrictive policies but they still exist on a curve/spectrum.  
Meaning in relative terms they are less than the respective Indian tariffs across multiple domains.  
Chinese tariffs were higher relative to many Western/OECD states NOT India, hence partly why Trump used raising US tariffs as a tool in his Trade War.  

There is a reason India backed out of RCEP, because India can't compete with Asian Tigers, SEA and Chinese economy on low/even tariff system. Or maybe it could(and we underestimate ourselves) but politically it can not because of the power of these trade and other unions which will be decimated at first before this destruction leads to more competitive Indian productivity (assuming everything goes according to plan, but India is too chicken to risk it, for now at least). 

> China doesn't give a shit about WTO

Patently wrong, it gives a lot of care both in terms of the commitment given to it in terms of technical change in recognition after 15 years of WTO membership but also because it engages in plenty of WTO dispute cases (US leading in this). Meaning it cares or else it wouldn't be taking part in them. 

Even the current Australian Beef & Barley sanctions are based technically on WTO guidelines, meaning it cares. 

>  India should do the same even if leads a case at WTO. Fuck WTO.

This is sort of silly takes which leads to condition countries in Africa or likes of Pakistan finds itself. 

China is here today because it played the Global system it didn't say to heck with the Global System. There is a vast difference between managing something and saying FU to that. Former is mature, latter is juvenile. And Govt knows this and why it hasn't officially supported the calls for Boycotting even though we know its affiliates like the RSS wing bodies and many Trade Unions (which had long BJP support links) are used as proxies. Meaning India is deploying asymmetric Trade War with China because an overt one hurts India because if India loses at the WTO it will be worse for India. So why do it officially when unofficially it is being tried. 

> at the same time it's making life worse for many many people who could have been employed in manufacturing these items imported from China.

This is a gross fallacy and devoid of any grounding proof.  

Do you know the numbers regarding firms which relocated out of China to other developing countries and what share did India have in them?  
https://www.livemint.com/industry/manufacturing/why-manufacturers-are-not-rushing-into-india-11570429217983.html

Meaning India can't even compete with countries which are multiple orders smaller, potentially less capable than them and one is to buy the argument that ONLY IF, there weren't these cheap Chinese products lives would have been better. 

This is a fantasy. India had first mover advantage in terms of local mobile OEMs with half a dozen of them being relevant and yet they squandered that when the Chinese OEMs finally came like a decade later to the scene. 

If even a decade head start is not enough your statement is unfounded and a fallacy. 

> Everyone of these labour intensive products imports lead to unemployment in India.

See the report from Oct 2019 above. There is plenty to make in the world and Indian internal market is big enough itself given that Chinese items across a wide range are still highly tariff-ed just like others. This statement would be valid if India wasn't getting out-competed on certain low level sectors by Bangladesh, Pakistan and Vietnam.  

Even the Pharma sector of India is reliant to Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients from China (which China supplies close to 80-90% on a global scale) and Chinese own Pharma & bio-sciences sector is much more advanced. 

The only 2 things which India had better was the IT sector because it started earlier on it and because of the English language proficiency being taught earlier in India relative to China where it picked up in 2000s so the first generation of graduates who are proficient are only now joining their workforce.  

And as seen over the 2010s, Indian IT no longer has that edge over Chinese IT stack either, they have enough domestic players of quality.  
The other was Banking finance modernization like IMPS (upon which UPI is made), it is THE premier stack in the world bar none, meaning no other country has a better system than this. But Chinese have enough to not require an alternative and neither does India require Chinese solutions on this sector, let alone Western who are decades behind on this. India doesn't allow Chinese Banks and China doesn't have Indian banks even of the scale that other Western countries have, meaning its not even a fair comparison because India at least first has to match Western companies level before it can cry Chinese are blocking. Clearly they weren't blocking when opening up to those Western countries, or else who did they end up there. Something would have happened, its obvious. 

Meaning it is a sector wise issue. Those saying China blocks Indian investment are missing the point of India barely has anything to offer of much value which China already doesn't have. Plus on top of that its moving up the value chain. And its a myth that Indian labor is cheapest in the world, in reality when PPP considerations are made India labor system creates a dynamic where labor is not cheap enough to be globally competitive, hence the outcome of that Oct article above.  
 
Although Oyo did expand like crazy and its Chinese operations became bigger than even Indian ones before its expansion issues started to cause its problems. So success can happen but it also requires daring because Chinese market is much more ruthless and mature than Indian one because they have had that destructive productive cycle already decades ago. China competes with the world, meaning its playing a different game and India can only match this IF its players match their level in their market and that is not easy because why would Indian companies even try that when their Indian operations alone are so massive or in many cases under threat from other Non-Indian vectors.  
Indian e-com sites for example, kept fighting each other and then had to deal with Amazon like a behemoth and now they can't focus on expansion elsewhere because they'd get walloped by Amazon of the little they do have going for them.  


> It's the government's fault for behaving as if this country is some middle income country and choosing a consumption led economic policy.

This may be a fair critique but it also is not so simple, because of PPP dynamics, India actually does have a internal consumption economy which is massive and unusual for its stage of development. Plus it becomes political because this class of people are politically powerful as voters. Meaning Party in Govt sort of becomes a passenger rather than some deliberate actor.

Furthermore having such widespread distributed supply chains also increase risk rather than reduce it, as we saw with 2017 Thailand floods (and also in 2011) which messed up the Global HDD pricing for more than 2+ years.

Post Covid world is going to need growth and who gives global growth to the world? There is an obvious answers because its global growth contributions are 30%+.  

After the initial emotional hysteria, Govts across the world are going to be pressured from their people to deliver. That is what will shape the global response.

so basically for each chinese good there exist a non chinese substitute at the same price and yet china dominates manufacturing ? This simply can't be true in equilibrium in the long run.


Consider 10 chinese good and 10 non chinese good which are the exact same and at the same price and the world demand for goods to be 12. 
Let's say because of some intial advantage (first mover advantage) china becomes the supplier of 10 goods in the world market and the rest 2 comes from non chinese firms (i.e china dominates manufacturing of this good) this would mean the non chinese firms will decrease production because keeping at the same level of production(10 goods) would mean the cost of rest of the goods would never be recuperated and they will be losing money. Hence a profit maximizing firms will reduce production. 

So it can't be simultaneously than china dominates world manufacturing & the exact same substitute for chinese product exists at the same price if we believe firms are profit maximizers.


>They have an overwhelming control on this ""assembly"" 

this is what people mean when they say china dominates manufacturing that most of the assembly is done there while you're thinking that the whole production is done there.

HDD does/did have distributed production, the biggest blip was in 2011. Even when China had such a hold of supply lines a regional flooding in 1 part of 1 small country still ended up disrupting a global supply of an item for years on end. 

There is only so much you can stretch distribution before it becomes counter productive to even have supply chains like that. We have supply chain efficiencies for a reason to being with. If the argument is balance sure but people aren't arguing that, most people are arguing from an emotional angle on this debate which is impractical and won't work. 

> You cannot be sure that the prices gonna increase.

For all items across the board on all sectors, probably not since India still has decently high tariffs on Chinese imports already, as it does from those other countries where part of the supply chains are moving, meaning India isn't going to see the benefits of these companies moving out of China all that much. 

But for a lot of product classes not much will change since if Indian companies are in total hold of their own domestic market the prices will obviously rise because why not. There would be no competition (since West doesn't compete on low value chain classes) so why lower pricing. Jio is just the latest example, when there were 10-12 telecom players it disrupted the market, not that there are only 3-4 its raising pricing because people have less choice. 

> you have to blame the society not the govt.

This is only partly true. In China and basically most societies where Women's lives got better the change was top-down first. Which it was/is in India as well, Laws supporting women and minorities came first before society was ready. But these laws are ineffective because they are there in ink not spirit because the essence of them are not implemented in Govt policy.  

So yes it is on the State/Govt. 

> Please stop looking at everything from the same perspective.

Dude you were the one who made a ridiculously generic equivalence of China Bad because Liberty which missing the picture and nuance of WHAT Liberty ACTUALLY is in practice. 

Yes being able to vote or speak against the Govt is Liberty, of course it is.  
But so is being able to wear what you want, able to marry who you want, able to have opportunities in whatever field you want, able to eat what you want.  
Able to walk alone at 2AM in the streets as a women. THAT IS LIBERTY. 

No place on the face of the Earth has Absolute Liberty and never will because its an oxymoron concept. Meaning everywhere has a spectrum of it and China ain't lesser than India at this stage. That is a factual statement and not one which is looked at through to quote you, ""same/narrow perspective"".

> If society standard increases automatically women will have more rights and freedom.

You need to learn more history because your comments are coming off as highly ignorant. 

Mao under 4 years of PRC establishment upended China's 4000 year old Patriarchal dominated society. So yes it can happen right away and doesn't need so called society advancement even though 7 decades ought to have been enough for that anyway. 

> There is no rule in Indian constitution affecting their right or freedom.

Yes because whatever is written in Constitution are followed to the tea and everyone lived happily ever after. 

> So please keep your leftist mind aside

WTH, how did you attribute a political spectrum to me even when you don't know me and what my comment said was NOT leftist but common freaking sense.  
Unless you hold the position Liberty and Women's rights are Left issues. 

Utterly ridiculous. 

> You and me have to change to make it better for women not the constitution.

You and Me already are doing it, have done it, as did our parents generation. There is a ceiling, a limit to which social actors, individuals can affect change in Society. 
This is why human groups even make Govts & States to begin with, to make the hard choices across a wider scale at a faster timeline.  

It is the Govts which leads on this because they have the capacity to effect that. This is how it happened elsewhere and this is how it will happen in India when it eventually will, because it will, others have just gone ahead of India on this front, which  is not a trivial thing to ignore because India doesn't claim to be a no body, it claims to be a champions of Democracy and Liberty, meaning it will judged on that prism not on some antiquated lose marking board with free marks being handed for participation alone. 

> Well what you know about china. The whole media is controlled and owned by government. They decide what to be released and what not to be. If any govt start filtering out the news being published. Even pakistan will start looking better than western and you will also start to believe that its way better than India. Coz the true picture is never released.

And this media system is relevant why exactly? 

Do you think US media is accurate to the point it leads to better information and choices for its people and those around the world?  

Or are you of the view Indian media is good because its so free and thus by extension informs the public in a good and accurate manner? 

Chinese media being less free is trivial to their progress on all fronts, be it social, economic or strategic. 

We have enough body of knowledge on China from non-Chinese sources and research over years to know that what they have achieved is Real, it is not a facade. 

No one fake it for 40 years. NO ONE. 

> We are digressing from the topic 

Yes because your comment took it in that direction because you misunderstood the fundamentals of how these policy changes will affect in a cascading manner over time. 

> If a govt or a state sponsors such world wide event I want it to go down.

You've been reading too much nonsense media. China didn't not sponsor it any more than India sponsors TB and NDM bacterial strains. Others competencies are not China's fault.  

If poor developing nations like Vietnam can get a hold of this, so can others. Period. 

> If such state or govt is not draconian then god knows what is.

I already told you what that is. A State which allows 500 Million people across multiple generations to die in poverty and 200 Million CHILDREN to die in that same time as well. 

That is not draconian, that is intentionally malevolent, i.e. a much worse grading/classification.  

If you are informed enough, they you'll know which State is being talked about here. If not then you need to read more and gather more knowledge because at least the Chinese people have the excuse of, Hey we have a censored system. What's the excuse for rest of the world's people for not knowing basic history.

Yes and those competitors adjusting production via market signals takes time and for big players like laptops, electronics its more like a monopolistic or oligopolistic competition, so not ""tons"" of competitors. Read my example again. All it requires for a welfare loss (assuming no knock on effects) is a non availability of substitues for each and every chinese products. If indian demand for laptops is 80 and only 40 of these are supplied by chinese firms and rest by non chinese. Then a boycott of chinese firms will mean a shortage and a rising price (loss in incomes) since rest of the non chinese firms cannot adjust their global supply chains overnight to catchup with the increased demand.  This also has other knock on effect like less consumption means less tax revenue and if any non chinese supplier served as an intermediate input to these chinese firms they would bear the cost too. Lots of people have to bear losses and it wouldn't even do what its supposed to.

No removing companies in already monopolistic or oligopolistic industries via boycott only increases monopoly rents derived by the remaining players (since it increases their market power) and there is literally no reason to believe either new companies will spring up or existing companies can arbitrarily increase their production in a short window of time where this boycott takes places. Increasing production requires land, labor, capital and TFP (knowledge, management practices, transport networks, supply chain networks etc - total factor productivity). None of these things grow on trees. This boycott is equivalent to the govt imposing a tariff or quota on chinese imported products. A simple supply demand analysis will tell you it leads to welfare losses in the short run.


In the short run this will cause loss and even if other companies can increase production this will lead to the industry becoming more monopolistic. And since it doesn't make a dent in china's GVC it won't affect china but instead it would invite retaliatory tarrifs, quotas and similar treatment of indian exports in china (more loss on our side).

so now you're back to arguing import substitute Industrialization. Good. at least be honest with yourself and admit it requires temporary loss in consumption. A simple analysis of [supply & demand](http://internationalecon.com/Trade/Tch100/T100-4.php) tells you this.
