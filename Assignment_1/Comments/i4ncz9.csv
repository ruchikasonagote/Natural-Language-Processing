The rain here is terrible. Its like Satan playing some game. No mercy rain, every year.
The roads flow away, the market is washed away. We see trees and buildings falling. Don't even ask about the slum areas.

We don't have the liberty to complain. Coz the ruling party is state's favourite. We just sleep like that. Get up next morning. And go to work. Be it heavy rain, be it a terrorist attack, or a pandamic.

> Just like many others in the city, Singh, a resident of Kurla and a father of two, had opened his business on Wednesday after being driven to penury during the lockdown -- one of his two daughters lost her job and the family exhausted all its savings. But within hours the street outside the shop was flooded and he had no option but to pull down the shutters and start a long, lonely trek home. When this correspondent last spoke to him around 8 pm, Singh was yet to reach home.

g0m4foc,"As a US-trained, American drainage control and flood management engineer with experience in the US through FEMA and the USGS, and in Asia and the Middle East through ADB, USAID, and WB, I wonder what the Indian government agencies are doing to manage Mumbai's stormwater flooding. Pumping stations and discharge pipelines; flood-diversion structures, tunnels,  canals, and storage ponds; rooftop rainwater collection; bio-swales; artificial groundwater recharge basins; flood-zone relocation, early warning and evacuation networks... The current flooding seems to be from the highest rainfall since 2005.

From the UN Sustainability Goals for Mumbai, 2010:  

""As a highly vulnerable city to major natural disasters, Mumbai has experienced several major extreme weather events within the past decade that have effectively brought the city to a standstill and caused severe human and economic losses. In response to the growing need for a contingency plan, the city of Mumbai drafted the Disaster Risk Management Master Plan that outlines the city's commitment to mitigating future risk and damages that could potentially result through future natural disasters.  


""Building upon the 2005 Disaster Risk Management Plan (DRM,) Mumbai released an updated and more comprehensive disaster relief and emergency operations plan in 2010. Since the city of Mumbai is an extremely vulnerable city to major flooding events, the 2005 Disaster Relief Management plan focused largely on efforts related to flood control. In July of 2005, Mumbai experienced a massive flash flood that resulted in over 5,000 deaths and severe economic losses. In addition, the floods severely damaged basic municipal infrastructure and resulted in a widespread contamination of the city's water and food supplies, resulting in a significant human health crisis after the flood as well.  


""It was determined that three factors led to the scale of the disaster: an antiquated storm-water drainage system, uncontrolled and unplanned development in the northern suburbs, and the destruction of mangrove ecosystems. As a result, the 2005 DRM plan was designed to reduce the impact of future extreme weather events. Massive public works projects were established to help reduce the risk of the city to future floods and the consequences of such events. The plan also outlined steps to protect human health before, during and after these extreme weather events to help combat the spread of communicable diseases around the city. In addition, the plan also included the enhancement of advanced monitoring and warning systems that would alert Mumbai's population of nearly 13 million of impending disasters.""
