gtl3miw,The whole scam is in their refund guarantee.They have to act like a teacher for the refund period. The child is told that they will get a tab. The child guilts his parents about getting the tab for education purposes which he will use for online gaming. They are not selling education. They are selling refurbished tab for 10 times markup,335,0,1617726679.0,SnooFoxes2411,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

Mentors are basically only for logistical stuff and communications. We were told mentors would help with doubts. That was a lie. Some videos are really crappy and just have a guy solving some problems on paper with trash audio quality.

gtkuvku,"Think of the long-term psychological impact this guilt could leave on the kid. And why are these BYJU's subscriptions are for multiple years? If their product is any good, make it monthly. Imagine paying for Netflix for multiple years at once and once payment is done, you CAN NOT cancel the subscription.  Then would they give any good movies/services?

Byjus now sell up to 6 years of course at once, earlier they even used to sell directly for 10 years!

This is just the tip of the iceberg, this issue of Byjus is way bigger. And again, the ENTIRE MEDIA is silent like nothing is happening at all.

If anyone of you or your known is trying to get a refund from Byjus, feel free to contact me, will do everything possible to get your money back.

Initially I had so much expectations and I thought I would be able to clear CAT by studying their material. As I was in a remote town I had no access to TIME or IMS then . So I chose Byjus as I believed it provided Online education and good personal mentor support. I was totally shattered after I began using it . The videos were pathetic and outdated and provided no clarity to concepts and there was no proper mentor support to clear my doubts. Still I tried to make maximum use of the material and tried learning sincerely for a whole month. But The material was simply of no use. Even a 300 Rs Arun Sharma book was way way better and very updated than this.

Surprise, surprise, the tab stopped functioning, and then the card was transferred to a phone. It got wiped when we forgot to take it out when purging it. Turns out they don't give extras, so the agent just told ud to get the shitty online version instead, which isn't fast and the software is buggy af.

But it turns out that the scholarship actually was a pendrive with ""25k worth"" study materials. But if they had to continue they have to pay the remaining amount. Like most middle class families, they refused it the moment they were asked to pay money. After few days had passed, the father of the Byjus representative came to their home this time. He told my aunt that how his daughter had to complete her target or else she would loose her job or something. What happened next is something I had never seen or heard about and shows how shitty this company is. Her father was willing to pay for the Tablet. So they took the money and then bought the tablet from the girl kr through the girl or something like that.

Couple things I learnt from this:

*  Indian parents are very gullible and easily fall into Byjus trap of ""Your kid is special so buy our device""  They also get to boast how their child got a scholarship to their family and friends.

*  If this is how the employees are treated that they are forced to spend their own money just to keep their job then imagine the pressure on parents and students.",2,0,1617766974.0,d3xm0rg,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral

I am in final year of my graduation. I had also purchased BUJU’s subscription. I am satisfied with the kind of knowledge I got from BYJU’s.
After watching those videos, I came to know that the way we studied is not the way to study. And I don’t know about you guys, but I have asked most of the students or my classmates too, some logical question which they were not able to answer.

I know schools are not just for studies, but lets talk just about the study part. The fees that private schools and private tutors are having, and the kind of knowledge most students have, I feel paying Rs. 23000 for studies will definitely benefits you. I have seen most students using an iphone in a age where they used it just for either showing off or for using social media applications only.

Yes one more thing I have seen most students making their parents fool by showing their report cards and also showing them the percentage they have scored. And when they sit in a competitive exam, then they starts knowing about themselves.

Whatever happens with the girl was very unfortunate, but there are a millions of downloads of BYJU’s application. Why we are just  making judgements based on one side.

gtnsgi0,"I also have a similar experience. Back in 2016, I was in 9th standard. I was going to a local coaching that was charging about Rs. 700/month for Maths and Science. I scored a good 10 cgpa that year without much efforts. When I got in 10th, I convinced my parents to admit me to Aakash. I actually cried and tried to persuade them in the name of clearing NTSE. Only I know that it was all done under peer pressure. My best friend and 9-10 others had already enrolled for Aakash and this was giving me FOMO. Finally, my parents agreed to admit me to Aakash, Bhopal. I remeber they charged about 44k in EMIs for whole year. And guess what, I couldn't clear NTSE, nor I could score a good CGPA. I got 9.8. The teaching was good but it gets so exhausting that there is no energy left in you to focus on self study. Wake up in the morning, go to school, come back at 3, get ready for coaching by 3:30, 4-8 pm coaching, get back to home, have dinner and go to bed. Life is none less than hell.
In the following year, they approached me to enroll for 11-12th and prepare for NEET/JEE. I was so confused that I couldn't decide what should I go with, PCM or Humanities (I have always dreamt of cracking UPSC). I don't know how they got us in their trap and made us submit 11k as advance with the tag of 'fully refundable'. Eventually, I chose Humanities and still continuing my graduation from DU. 
I literally wasted 44k + 11k (that was clearly never refunded) + 8k (700/month van fees). 
I regret my decision of getting into their shitty and so called educational environment and would never advice anyone of you to do the same. You gotta know that all it takes to crack these exams is already in you, just buried in some corner. You have to work hard, while being serious and disciplined.

I sell you a 100Mbps internet connection and give you a trial period of 1 month. You like the service and agree to get a 1 year contract because you save money on that compared to the monthly payment.

Harassment can occur I won't deny it. But there are ways around it. Blocking numbers, silencing and filing complaints. The point is those aren't legal retaliations. And that's because the company can't really legally retaliate. They can't force someone into paying for a service in perpetuity.

I suspect if you ignore it they'll eventually give up. Those are physical man hours their company is wasting trying to follow up. But you can also escalate legally if it persists. It's a different situation. Personally I'd take harassment over losing a bucketload of money.
