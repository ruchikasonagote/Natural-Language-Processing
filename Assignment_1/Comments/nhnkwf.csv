>As a young boy, after working in a family tea shop in the morning, Modi would daily reach the Sharmishtha lake near his home in Vadnagar.

>According to the book, he would swim all the way to a temple in the middle of the lake, touch the flag on its top and return to the shore. He did this thrice daily. ""Once, Narendra was badly injured when a crocodile hit his left foot with its tail,"" the book says.

>A crocodile tail is strong; a hit by it can be fatal. It is like you are struck with a sword. Villagers say there used to be 29 crocodiles in the lake.

>""Narendra was an eighth grade student then. He got nine stitches on his left foot near the ankle and was bed-ridden for more than a week. The cut marks are still there on his left foot.""

Sorry about that.

But yes, if one has a smart TV, having a digital cable sub is pretty much obsolete since it's more expensive and doesn't offer as much as streaming services.

The moment my family got a smart TV around 2 or so years back (first time I bought a streaming sub was last year, however), digi cable subscription pretty much became irrelevant and an unnecessary expense in my household.

EDIT: guess, I didn't factor the prices of network connection. Basic cable sub might be around 150-200rs minimum whereas, most basic Wifi plans are around 500-600rs minimum, I guess",17,3,1621604771.0,TheFatherofOwls,1621605064.0,negative,negative,negative,negative

gzhwwhj,"But there were no elections if the main focal spreader states viz Maharashtra and Delhi. They also created scare among migrant workers so that they returned to their villages in UP and Bihar, and some in Haryana. In this way they exported the disease deliberately deep into Indian heartlands. Kerala was the other main focal spreader.  
The disease has spread because of peopel not having discipline and not wearing masks.  
The focal states did not add beds, hospitals, oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators or ventilator in the period of last quarter of last year almost until last month. They wanted DRDO or Centre to do it. Why? They did not declare lockdowns also. We have seen how rapidly teh disease has begun to come under control after lock downs were promulgated. State governments could have saved the people from hospitalisation, deaths, bankruptcy and untold misery, besides saving nation's resources now being spent on creation of facilities , oxygen, drugs and so on, which will be wasted after the pandemic comes under control.  
All because the CMs didn't care about people's lives. They just wanted to defame the PM, GOI and to defame the country abroad., no matter people were dying.

This is a huge part of the problem though and it can't be ignored when discussing Modi. The man is an extreme right-wing religious ideologue who wants to transform the entire core nature of the country. If you don't believe in religion then you should be afraid of the BJP and what they are doing. They have set themselves up as a political-religious cult of personality hell-bent on destroying the secular principles on which our country was founded. They are trying to implement religious fundamentalism as a normal part of political life. They are amplifying centuries of communal and religious hatred and using it to their advantage. They are creating an underclass of religious and ethnic minorities while convincing the majority that *they* are the ones being oppressed by the minorities. It's not just the British who used divide and rule... BJP is giving them a run for their money.

If given the chance, Modi will turn India into a country where non-religious people like you and I will have no place. Under the BJP we are headed for a Hindu version of Pakistan. It is just happening few decades late.",4,3,1621608000.0,TheLastSamurai101,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

you have no idea how this scam is being implemented. this is to convince the ethnic majority to help the people in power to maintain the status quo. they encourage them to act disruptive to ensure that their segment of the population stagnates while the only growth is in the immigrant population. this is all a scam to reduce labor costs.

whie supremacy and hindu supremacy is to encourage incel like behavior among these men. they will die a virgin. and their ethnic communities will not grow. their disruptive behavior discourage the growth of immigrant communities. so the only way to grow the population is via new immigrants who are willing to work for the least amount of money.
