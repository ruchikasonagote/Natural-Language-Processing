Residence: IAS officers generally get huge houses as residences on very low or no rent. They also can avail of the services of maids, cooks, gardeners, security guards, etc.

Transport: They are allotted one or more vehicles with chauffeurs for official purposes.

Security: Due to the high profile and sometimes dangerous nature of the job, IAS officers are provided with security guards for themselves and even their family. In case of a life threat, they can even get STF commandoes for their protection.

Bills: They generally get free or highly subsidised electricity, water, gas and phone connections.

Trips: IAS officers enjoy subsidised accommodation in government guest houses or bungalows when on official or non-official trips. When visiting Delhi, they can avail of accommodation in their State Bhavans

I want to know in her office building ""does she have common bathroom where everyone goes?""

And just now from other website.. I found this..
As a student asked Bamhrah that the government is providing school dress, scholarship, bicycles and many other facilities to students, can't it provide sanitary pads for Rs 20 to 30 to girls students - drawing applause, Bamhrah hit out, saying that people are clapping over the question but these are endless demands.

Today, the government would provide you with sanitary pads for Rs 20 to Rs 30. Then you ask for jeans, pants and then, beautiful shoes,"" she said but did not stop there.""When it comes to family planning, will the government give condoms (Nirodh) to you. Why would I have a habit of taking everything free from the government? What is the need of it?""

At that, the student said the government comes to them to seek their votes. Bamhrah angrily replied that ""this is the height of stupidity. You don't vote and go to Pakistan. You are giving a vote to take money and facilities from the government"".

That girl student responded that she is an Indian and why would she go to Pakistan?""The government is providing facilities from the money of taxpayers. If taxpayers are paying taxes to the government, why would they not demand for the services?"" she asked.

Another girl student claimed problem in toilets for girls in the school, saying that the boys also enter the girls' toilet and make them uncomfortable.At this, Bamhrah asked if every student present in the hall has separate toilets for them at home, leaving many in the audience surprised and shocked at the tenor of the senior IAS officer who demeaned the girl students.

Edit..
BJP spokesperson Santosh Pathak said: “The way the bureaucrat spoke to the girl defeated the very purpose of the workshop. It was very irresponsible and insensitive on part of the WDC MD to speak in the manner she did. And there was no need to make Pakistan reference at all.”

While the bureaucrat was not available for comment, Social Welfare Minister Madan Sahani said: “Our department works for welfare of girls and women. She should not have discouraged the girls. The workshop was meant to encourage them. Our department secretary will speak to the MD on Thursday.”

Her reaction to all of this. So is that video and news is false ? 

Calling the video false, malicious and wrong reporting, Bhamra said, “Some mischievous elements against whom stringent action has been taken by the Women Development & Child Welfare (WCDC) for omissions and commission of wrongdoings, having lost at each forum, have now resorted to such low attempts to malign my reputation.”

Most Indians don't pay taxes so increasingly what we see is middle classes being heavily taxed to support poor people. Year in and out this group is going to constrict due to cost of living and fewer children. 

With mechanisation you don't need so many people. Amar Kissan nonsense also means India's rural population is lionised when in reality a huge chunk of it is kept in artificial poverty. 

There's not enough jobs, not enough training and India's tryst with Hindu extremism is eroding the value of its educated export. But that's the distraction. 

India's population needs to come down. It's vital. Just as much as removing corruption which is tragically rampant. India's reputation is being eroded globally by these idiots. India's lionised medics are reeling from the mishandling of COVID. The lies told by places like Bihar have directly affected the validity of medical research.
