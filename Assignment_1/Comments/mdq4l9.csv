gsdtux8,"There literally was a post on this sub yesterday along the topic of this post (that Western guy who makes Indian food image posts which get high traction/upvotes).

Meaning this ain't a Youtube thing. 

Though to me the difference between this reddit guy's post and someone like Jaby would be that even after so many years Jaby has not learned a single Indian language (likely based on the logic that there are too many Indian languages and English suffices or he's bad at learning new languages, which is a ridiculous argument because with enough effort it's still possible and secondly English is not an Indian Language and that point dominates. For a foreigner who wants the most scaled interaction learning Hindi suffices) while this reddit guy at least learned to invest time in Indian cooking (and this likely impacts social circle around him in real life as well) and food is after Language THE dominant identity strain of a Culture/Society/People. So the reddit guy should get a soft pass for now. 

However, the longer it goes and the longer foreigners avoid learning the language the worse their credibility becomes. This goes in both direction. Indian emigrating to some other country and telling themselves to heck with learning their language are toxicity personified. It doesn't need to be emigrating dynamic itself specifically, it can be someone which is related to employment/survival/standard-of-living while staying in India. 

This (willingness to learn another language) is a pretty easy way of determining how much ""Respect"" is being shown by someone towards a group of people.

This is not where the debate is happening around this.

Context here is, using that to make social media posts and build your profile. This is what Jaby does, but with art-content (i.e. a slice of music, movies, etc of India). 

Language IS Culture, like quite literally. When one asks what is Culture, the answer is Language. It is the literal medium which carries the meaning and the capacity to express that meaning of that culture. 
When a language replaces another, a different way of describing it is a Culture is replacing another because ALL Languages have their Own culture-set because they arose in that.

People brush this aside on grounds of Language is just a communication tool.  
Yes, it is that But that is a part of the larger whole. Human beings are not inanimate robots, simply having a communication tool ain't enough because if that was so we'd never have invented our capacity to use Language to begin with since animals ""Communicate"" well enough to survive 100s of millions of years. That works just fine, it doesn't need this abstraction layer, it arose because it matters more. 

And back to your query, it matters when there is appropriation over a sustained period of time because otherwise it becomes non-genuine, manipulative and exploitative.",4,3,1616847602.0,iVarun,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
gsfscpc,"The only thing nauseating is grovelling for self validation from people one doesn't know or have a positive/healthy connect with. 

If your literal livelihood is sustained by a dynamic which is foreign for a sustain period of time (this bit is critical) and your reaction is to heck with learning the language of those foreigners, it is tacit insulting to not just those people but in a professional capacity as well since given that this is a paid setting that means knowing more about the society will help both sides form better interaction/synergy. 

So yes, we get footballers playing for years in a foreign country and never learning the language because one doesn't need to learn some language to be able to kick a ball. But it is still discourteous, immature, exploitative, un-cultured and so on.  

So yes one can do it, and people do do it. So be prepared for the above monikers to be associated with you and if you don't care then so be it. 

As for regarding the westerner who posts food posts on this sub, as stated for now his situation is different to Jaby's since the timeline is shorter and monetary dynamic is not present but over enough time with enough Social Media visibility dynamic the gap between these 2 ain't all that much. 

Not everyone is after money. If one is after fame/visibility or how awesome they are and so forth, that still applies the same. 

This isn't even freaking an India thing. This applies to Everyone on the planet in a cross linguistic/cultural dynamic.

If someone comments on my life when they watch me, I have a natural right to counter if/how-much they know me. Same applies to the context of this post and chain (both Jaby and the food post guy).",0,3,1616848336.0,iVarun,1616848521.0,negative,negative,negative,negative
gsfumno,"Both are wrong. 

Exceptions may be really old parents who move with their children or grandchildren. And this is really only an exception because of learning capabilities at that age.  

Otherwise, it is basic courtesy to get to know the other esp when that other is so central to what you are getting from them (i.e. be it money/employment or just validation which is a catch-all term here for social media popularity thing, bottonline being you are getting something which you deeply crave, and in return it is basic decent thing to do to learn the language, IF as stated the timeline is long enough, because one ain't suggesting every time you take your annual holiday learn a new language, that is idiotic).  

And one can't truly know someone else if they don't know the language. There are levels of knowing and if you don't understand the native language you don't understand the culture, you are interpreting the culture, the difference is critical/significant and that matters because of the timeline and the serious exchange that is happening in this context.

I have often found on this sub over the last decade that for a place which has no Linguistic peer on this planet (i.e. India) and with no such thing being a Monolingual Indian person (I don't think such a person literally exists in India), the actual people (esp the post 90s generation) seems totally oblivious to dynamics of Language. 

The most they seem to stick to is, it's a communication medium and that is enough and don't force your Language XYZ on me politics and that is it.  

There is barely any broader understanding of what a Language entails at a larger scale across domains from society to historical developments to development, collective identity, evolution of culture and so on.",2,3,1616849296.0,iVarun,False,neutral,negative,positive,neutral
