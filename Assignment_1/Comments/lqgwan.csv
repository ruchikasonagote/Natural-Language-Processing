I mean I'm sorry you construed it that way but Westerners themselves think their education system in mathematics is garbage. Of course, there are many brilliant people who go on to study math in graduate school and beyond but they are not representative of the whole population.

>some of the hardest mathematical questions of our time have been solved by westerners

I think we're talking about two completely different topics here. One is to promote mathematical learning amount school students (which India goes overboard with) and the other is to promote graduate studies in mathematics and other scientific fields (which China/and the West are doing well). A very big problem in India right now is that there simply doesn't exist enough money in research to incentivize brilliant students to participate. 

I studied at a top-tier college in India and my brother has gone to an IIT and I can assure you, the career outcomes from both places are equivalent to an Ivy League school.

I think that is a misconception though I do not pretend to speak for westerners, the major criticism I have heard online is rather than teaching them proper math they are taught abstract concepts with no practical applications which is its own can of worms. So I do not think westerners care about the mathematical quality of their system but rather the overall quality of the system. But if there are any westerners here feel free to prove me wrong.  


>They are totally relevant. China is facing the same ""issue"" and has been unable to solve it.

The GaoKao is a general exam for all fields very similar to the SAT but much much harder. The problems facing the GaoKao are not the same as the JEE and NEET because the purpose is different. Right now the Gaokao has a problem because it is overly standardized and not specific to different industries like the JEE and NEET, while the JEE and NEET are saturating their industries, and other industry exams are much easier which means that those industries have lower quality professionals. Law for example has the SLAT CLAT MH CLET AILET and LSAT (for private unis) and while extremely competitive they are nothing compared to the JEE ad NEET, and at this point, the IBPS (banking) is a joke. I don't even want to mention more creative industries because there are no standardized exams and the quality of professionals in those industries is rarely comparable to their western counterparts. The GaoKao on the other due to its extreme standardization has made candidates lack specialization, and once they go in for bachelors they lack the prior knowledge needed to be competent in that field and while there is definitely something to be said about the Indian culture of \*rata mar\* it is nothing compared to the Chinese GaoKao. Finally, in regard to this point, the GaoKao has provided Chinese students unprecedented economic mobility as compared to the JEE and NEET, while the GaoKao allows up to 30% of students to get into top colleges, only 2% of students get into the top IITs while this definitely makes the process more selective and therefore produces a better crop of students, this also means economic mobility for Indian students is also much harder. So both exams have distinct sets of problems the only problem that is common is the high stress levels induced in students which definitely has to be addressed.

\> I think we're talking about two completely different topics here. 

\> most Western people aren't great at mathematics. 

My point was it does not matter whether most western people are good at mathematics or not, the point is that western people are expanding that field of research much faster and better than Indians.  And before you tell me that is the reason why 2% of JEE is better than 30% of the GaoKao these are bachelor level fields that are used in the industry itself, not in research. This brings me to your next point. 

\>Those people are choosing to run behind money and I can assure you that if money were offered (like how the NSF does in the US), then they would also conduct great research. 

The problem with that is you can easily make money with existing technology, people still make money with radios which is century-old technology. Bachelor students do not make future technologies with the exception of computer science but that is also due to the fact that computer science itself is still at the stage physics was back when Isaac newton was still studying gravity. However, in older fields such as Biology and Chemistry, the industry relies on PhD level candidates making new medicines or chemists making better alloys or bombs or fuels, finally, there is definitely an oversaturation of engineers to the point that now aerospace engineers are finding it difficult to find jobs, and they work mostly in defence! Indians again lag behind in all of these fields, even our best businessmen did not graduate from IIM, rather they graduated from the likes of Stanford and Harvard, Eg: Azim Premji (Stanford) Mukesh Ambani (Stanford) S. N. Subrahmanyan (London Business School), and Ratan Tata (Cornell).",1,7,1614123770.0,Daszehan,False,negative,negative,negative,negative
