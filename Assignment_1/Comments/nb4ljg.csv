Idk if you guys know but Ambani funded a movie in which the president's wife is an actor. (NOT SURE IF THE MOVIE GOT MADE)

https://newscentral24x7.com/rafale-deal-anil-ambani-reliance-entertainment-produce-french-film-with-french-president-hollandes-partne/

All this happened in the background of the Rafale controversy, and somehow miraculously, Ambani profited off this deal through offset clauses.

""Reports have suggested that Reliance, in some manner, will end up receiving as much as Rs 21,000 crore of the total Rs 30,000 crore offset expenditure""

I'm not a very smart guy so here is the link and one of you experts can explain it more clearly than I can.

The sentence like jaan jaye par dharm na jaye is the foolish statement of this hindutva.
Curse hindutva and not hinduism. I told you hinduism is different.
This is the same act, like snapchat has cursed indian people and indian people started to ban snapdeal. Do you really support this kind of foolishness? Then really you lack common sense too. sorry to say this, even if you downvote me but this is a truth.
I don't support this sanghis, modis ass licker and ofcourse modi. Hate and curse them and will pray that whoever mess with my country and its citizen should die slow and painful death.

Iran is what it is today because of US interference in its election by removing a democratic leader and establishing a puppet monarch. People got fed of it and it so happened that a religious leader was able to gain attention who saw the opportunity and took it. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27√©tat

The Taliban is a direct consequence of the war that was fough between the Mujahideens and the soviets when the latter came to invade the land. The Mujahideens were able to defeat them and get them kicked out after 1979. They were trained by ISI and funded by Saudi and US. And then the civil war happened because of power dynamic and then came the 2001 attack, 9/11. The US, without any reasoning as admitting it in recent times that they have no plan and no reason to stay there, attacked the Taliban in Afghanistan and caused the state of the country as it today. And the Taliban fights for the US to get the fuck out of the country as it‚Äôs primary reason. Then comes it wanting to be in power.

Also, pretty ignorant of you to say that point out two countries, which are pretty troubled and almost failed states to prove your statement. Forgot the rest? UAE, Saudi, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, Malaysia, Maldives, Brunei etc etc. Countries that are doing pretty well with Islam being the state/country official religion. One of which even most Indians go to vacation for (take a guess).

And to talk about Europe now. Again, pretty ignorant of you to think that religion wasn‚Äôt a part of it. It was and still is. State and religion were separate on paper but the Catholics and the Protestants still fought one another. I mean, one of the biggest examples is England where even with their own church and a royal family and all that stuff, it didn‚Äôt stop them from moving forward. Also, you talk about the Renaissance era? Again, religion based. Maybe not Christianity but it was Humanism. Only difference between the two is that in one, God is at the centre and in the other, humans are at the centre. And there was even a middle ground, Christian Humanism.

> I divide my officers into four groups. There are clever, diligent, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and diligent -- their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy -- they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent -- he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief.

Sure, his government was certainly founded on leftist Lenin-Marxist ideologies, but the actual execution of these ideals involved stripping power from the people, entrenching social heirarchies, and bending the will of the people through harsh penalties and demands, forced imprisonment, forced labor, forced relocations, and death squads.

>The father of Aylan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian Kurdish refugee who drowned off the coast of Turkey as his family fled violence, said he wept upon seeing the Charlie Hebdo cartoon portraying his late son as a monkey rapist.

>""When I saw the picture, I cried,"" Abdullah Kurdi¬†told AFP. ""My family is still in shock.""

>""What would little Aylan have grown up to be?"" its latest cartoon asks, referring to Aylan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian Kurdish refugee whose dead body washed up on a Turkish beach.

>An ""ass groper in Germany,"" it responds, referencing a¬†series of sexual assaults¬†on women in Cologne, Germany that were attributed to ""Arab and North African men."" The drawing depicts Middle Eastern refugees who fled brutal, Western-fueled wars in their respective countries as lascivious apes chasing a white European woman.

>One of its past cartoons shows the Pope surrounded by a crowd of dark-skinned people with the caption ""The Pope in Paris: The French are as stupid as ni**ers.""

>It has also published at least two other cartoons lampooning the death of Aylan Kurdi. ""Christians walk on water. Muslim children sink,"" read one, which showed the three-year-old refugee boy drowning.
Another depicts the corpse of the child face down on the beach with the words ""Welcome immigrants!"" and ""So close to his goal,"" along with a McDonald's sign reading ""2 kids menus for the price of one.""

>When Western-backed Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah al-Sisi massacred more than 800 peaceful protesters at Rabaa Square in August 2013, in what Human Rights Watch called a ""crime against humanity,"" Charlie Hebdo made fun of the deaths of the activists, many of whom were from the Muslim Brotherhood party and were challenging the U.S.-backed overthrow of Egypt's democratically elected government.

>Charlie Hebdo frequently portrays Muslims with large hooked noses and beards, in a style reminiscent of anti-Semitic portrayal of Jews in the early 20th century. Yet the publication does draw a line. While Charlie Hebdo uses Nazi-era imagery to portray Muslims, it¬†fires employees accused of anti-Semitism.

And faith is, in essence, a personal thing: how could one‚Äôs own voice be muted? There‚Äôs another confusion of yours: between religion and religious institutions.

It‚Äôs not that ‚Äúa lot of Renaissance stuff is heavily influenced by religion‚Äù, Renaissance is at its core a religious movement, as well as a political or philosophical one (I‚Äôm actually pretty sure there‚Äôs no difference between philosophy & theology in the eyes of your common Renaissance man). It did not at all encourage people to take liberties with their beliefs, but it did encourage thought-over faith: early Renaissance authors and painters in Florence were often religious men, and when they were not they had still been raised in a world where religion was a _given_. What they promoted is not a form of secularism, it‚Äôs self-conversion: people were to wonder ‚Äúwhy do I believe?‚Äù, not ‚Äúgod should be have to do with political affairs‚Äù, ‚Äúgod is not the Christian god‚Äù, or ‚Äúgod does not exist‚Äù.

The nations mentioned are not examples of how religious extremism has ruined nations when there have been no reasonable chance for a ‚Äúnation‚Äù to develop in the first place. 

In the case of Iran, the US and the UK literally murdered Iranian democracy and installed the Shah‚Äôs brutal dictatorship that murdered and tortured tens of thousands.

Then thirty years of sanctions, proxy wars, bombings, assassinations, and invading their neighboring nations sparking millions of refugees to flood into the region. I mean. Come the fuck on. I don‚Äôt like the Mullahs. But the fact is they arose directly as a result of western machinations. 

Afghanistan is even worse. British invasions. The Soviet invasion and occupation. US support for the religious extremist Mujahideen which became the Taliban. Then the US invasion. Then of course the Saudis, Chinese and Russians responded by funding and supplying the Taliban to fight the US. This is a hundred years of external interference. The nation never had a chance to develop. 

And the fact that Saudi Arabia and Israel are both about as driven and organized around extremist religious principles as you can get. Israel is a religious oligarchy for fuck sake and SA a religious dictatorship. And they are not crumbling. Because they are in the right side of the Superpowers.

God is great and so is religion. Humans aren‚Äôt and they are shit who drive to themselves to insanity and extremism. 

I believe there are different faiths and paths to one God and everyone to their own.

gxyv6il,"Yes I can agree to that, but you could use better examples from Europe and even South/East Asia itself. Afghanistan and Iran were not isolated from foreign criminal interferences and thus is unfair to call their lack of socio-economic progress a result of solely fundamentalist religious conservationism.

We can agree to disagree, surely.

With that, I will leave you this 1 minute clip, slightly off topic but slightly related on Afghanistan, from a USA Colonel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBthA9OHpFo",1,2,1620907272.0,TheAnonymouseJoker,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral
gxz9bem,"Left and Right is confusing for many because in France it is the opposite as a lot of countries !

Left   --> gauche

Right --> droite

Sorry for the confusion ! But our conservatives siege at the Right (Droite = FR, LR, EM, ...) and our progressists/socialists/... siege at the Left (Gauche = LFI, PS, EELV, ...)

gxy5l7n,I can't tell if you're baiting in bad faith but it's a common saying in India that there are 33 koti devtas which can be debated to mean both 33 crores (and the one most well known due to its absurd yet possibly true sounding claim) or 33 types (there are almost 33 Deities of Vedic origin).,5,2,1620885423.0,SenpaiOnTheBeat,False,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral

gxy6edw,"Yes, thank you for explaining. But it must be written some where. I am just looking for that particular book. Because each scripture has it's own ""pratigya"" or ""AIM"". For example in bhagwad gita pratigya is ""Dharma kshetre kuru kshetre"" which means what should be done in ""Iha lok and Par lok"" here ""Iha"" means within body and ""Par"" means outside body. So to conclude bhagwad Gita explains us how to behave with own self and with others to get salvation"" I just need the reference for the same i.e the ""pratigya"" of that particular scripture.
