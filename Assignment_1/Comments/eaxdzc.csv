Nepal, a neighbouring country of India, can teach many things about developing tolerace and co-operation in society. It is a much smaller country than India but I’d argue even more diverse. Until and unless Indian society learns to develop tolerance towards each other, I dont think there is any hope for the country. And if tolerance is so far-fetched, the country should be divided into many small nations. India never was a single entity. Its been an extremely forceful unification so far and Indians attitude towards their own dark-skinned members, ‘lower’ caste, uber hate for Muslims and vice versa, north-south division, hate and down-pointing languages in every conversations (small to big) towards people of ‘low’ class and occupation like Auto-driver, security guard and others reek of a very unhealthy society that shouldn’t live together.

There are many nations poorer and less educated than Indians but have a much more functioning civilized society and have much more potential in them such as Nepal.

1)even if we assume all muslims who stayed back rejected Islamic state (which is untrue) this person did not vote for/against it obviously. Just like we shouldn't judge today's muslims for the Iconoclasm,Genocide by muslim invaders reverse is also true across communities and events.

2)in 47 some 87% muslim vote went to muslim league and who did stayed back did inspite of voting for pakistan so for various reasons including their dream to convert whole of India and create darul-islam (Azad etc),didn't want to loose their property(rich muslims ex:daughter of Jinnah who congratulated her father),some others did not had means to make the journey etc. offcourse there were few probably who stayed back out of love. some of this is covered in this book : https://www.amazon.com/Creating-New-Medina-Venkat-Dhulipala/dp/1316615375

3)coming back to CAA , people are either misled ,misinformed or pure bigotry is the reason behind anti-CAA protests. this law only gives fast track citizenship option for persecuted minorities(Christian,Jain,Buddhist,Sikhs,Hindus) from neighboring countries who are already living in India before 2014.Muslims can still apply under normal forms & do get visa.Diff is 5 yrs vs 10 yrs. Does not affect any citizens. Muslims have applied during Modi govt and have been granted citizenship close to 600.This was the promise made by Mahatma Gandhi,Nehru,Babu Rajendra Prasad ,then congress working committee again re-iterated by Manmohan singh to stress CWC resolution and Mahatma Gandhi only specified to give it to persecuted non-muslims only fulfilled now after 70 years.

**100% wrong** , RSS/BJP's definition of hindu is 'BHAKT', a country full of bhakts will never be democracy, it would be 'Hindu ISIS'. 

India is a democracy because majority of people are 'less-religious', specifically hindus. Certain amount of non-religiousness is the cause of democracy if anything (all though we should all thank Nehru for india's strong democracy)

Like for me, I stayed through my whole schooling in my home state. The words ""Unity IN diversity"" were taught to me by my teachers and I proudly believed in it. Then I went to Delhi for college and I immediately witnessed the subtle as well as not so subtle cues, from classmates jokingly calling you foreigner, to people calling you Japanese or  Korean, etc.

To paraphrase Orwell, ""We are all Indian but some of us are more Indian than others"" is the sentiment many minority people deal with.

Now I'm not complaining. After 6 years I have grown used to cab drivers asking which country I am from, or hotel managers asking me for my passport while checking in. I am okay telling them I am Indian and showing either my Aadhar or Voter's ID. I don't find a need to make a hassle out of it. And I sure as hell can't speak for Muslims either but I have a strong feeling they have their own set of things they have grown accustomed to.

And I will agree also that these things are mostly borne out of ignorance and not racism or hate. (Which is in itself a big issue as Indian school system only focuses on a small part of the actual country, but that's a topic for another day).

But when you grow up in a system like that and then the government passes a bill or introduces something that seeks to strengthen those sentiments while they should be removing them, it is a concern for a lot of us.

Because hateful people don't need laws to be hateful. But when laws can be used as an excuse by those people, the results can be horrific.

I used to be proud of the words ""Unity in Diversity"" but after living in 4 different cities, I am not sure if 20% of people I have interacted with are proud to call me a brother or a fellow Indian.

Very true and well said. But how does this bill destroy secularism in India? Isn't it only about refugees seeking shelter because of religious persecution in other countries?

India happens to be one of the o ly 2-3 countries with a big Hindu population. And because the religion originated here, it is reasonable to say that a Hindu elsewhere shares som roots with India.  So it is logical for India to be a Hindu shelter state.

That is not true for Islam though. There are literally hundreds of Islamic majority countries where Muslims can seek shelter. And many of those countries are incredibly wealthy too, not massively resource constrained like India is.

This is not called being biased. This is called being practical. For example, job and education reservation for SC/STs was not an act of bias or persecution against upper classes. It was a means to provide support and help for the disadvantaged.

Are you also going to claim that SC/ST reservation was an act of destruction of India's society and cultural fabric?

Wrt the Pakistan thing. To me it seems like something that started off just to tick off those people who continuously keep promoting Pakistan as the ideal destination to migrate. Oh you think I should go to Pakistan? How about I support them right now in front of you. 

I know of a lot of Hindus who would go in front of Muslim houses to blast crackers cause Pakistan lost. I mean do they really think people living in India are inside going about like it’s a funeral cause Pakistan lost? Instead of maybe worrying about stuff that adults worry about?

In retaliation Muslims started ticking those guys off by blasting their own crackers. 

All of this behavior is quite juvenile tbh. But it is my conjecture where this stuff comes from. Over a period of time, depending on how you’ve been brought up, people have gotten umm quite serious in their loyalties. 

As for loving India, hating Pakistan. We don’t have to make a false dichotomy out of the situation. I left India when I was 18, and since then I have had the pleasure of meeting people from many different nationalities and I have been to 7-8 countries myself. And the best bonds of friendship I have ever had are with people from Pakistan. 

And it wasn’t just me. Most Indians and Pakistanis bond well. We eat the same food, watch the same movies, enjoy the same sports and you name it. Their lifestyle is same as ours. Heck even their politicians pull off the same shit that ours do. 

It is understandable that you do not share in their idea of a nation based on faith. Neither do I? But do I hate Pakistan for it? No. I don’t. They chose their own way and we did ours. My idea of a nation is based on what I believe is the best way forward — leave your religion in your house and don’t bring it in to public sphere.

This would be even remotely an argument if the bill (now act) didnt include non-Hindus. E.g. Buddhists and Christians are also included in the list. Since there are plenty of  Buddhist and Christian countries, according to your logic, these two religions should not have been included, just like Muslims.

Why stop there? Hinduism started with a group of middle easterners moving into indus valley . So why not share deeper roots with middle east?

Because there is no common connection.

They also have nowhere else to go. And they share a lot of common roots with India.

Firstly, colleges like St Stephen's give first preference to Christians. And they are funded upto 95% by the HRD ministry.

Well, that is subjective, right? There might be Hindus who do not identify anymore and there might be many who do. The roots are still the same.

The partition in 1947 had a condition, and I quote, ""the Hindu minority in Pakistan was to be given a fair deal in Pakistan in order to ensure the protection of the Muslim minority in India"".

I think we can agree upon that Hindu in Pakistan are treated much worse than Muslim minorities in India.

Talking about Ahmediya, I couldn't find any article on their inclusion or distribution during the partition. However, I did find that Pakistani parliament added an amendment in 1974 which made Ahmediya non Muslims - the reason provided was that ""according to the Government, they do not accept Muhammad as the last prophet of Islam.""

So, my understanding is that the India we have today certainly needs to fight for the rights of minorities declared during partition, because that was a mutual understanding of trust between the two newly formed countries.

True. I agree. Thinking about it deeper, there should be a periodically updated list of specific refugee communities that are ""white-listed"" in a manner of speaking.

No, I don't subscribe to that notion at all. In fact, I find that a very strange notion. Matter of fact, Buddhists and Jains and Sikhs can also claim that India is a Buddhist or Jain or Sikh nation, and they would be equally correct - even from that perspective. Because India is also the birthplace of all those other religions as well. 

The only point I made here was that when it comes to Muslims and Christians, there are tons of other countries that have have a majority presence of those populations. When it comes to Muslims, because of the way the religion is structured where the religion subsumes and manages all aspects of your life, the nations also call themselves Islamic nations rather than just being a nation with a Muslim majority. Christianity is lesser so in that regard, at least in the modern era. For refugees of those religions, there are plenty of other options too.

So I ask you in the name of secularism. Why is it that there are no educational institutions that protect the Hindu religion in India? 

And if the answer is that Hindu religion is a majority religion in India, then fair enough. I buy your point.


But then, when it comes to immigrants, which is a world wide scope, then by definition, they are a clear minority. And Muslims are not a clear minority because there are way more Muslims all over the world compared to Hindus. 

So why is it an issue?

How is religious violence being encouraged? Yes, I get it, local nonsense like the beef stuff happens. But statistically, do you have any proof? I already posted that India has not had any major religious riots in the last 8 years or so. 

Everyone forgets that this is literally the most populous country on earth. Obviously, crazy shit will happen. But isolated incidents are different from large scale destabilization riots that affects millions of people in a given city for generations. 

I have been through one such trauma. Trust me.

Wrong. Indian secularism is not a separation of state and religion. That is the Western model. Indian secularism takes an inclusive approach. Which is why you have different personal laws, you have religious boards that provide feedback to the government.

So what did I say that was incorrect about St Stephen's?  

My point is simple. Reservation and special policies for minority religions are clear examples of how Indian law works. It is based on practical need and not just ""fairness to everyone"".

Hindus are a minority religion worldwide. So for immigration, treating Hindus as minorities makes sense. 

Combine this with the practical situation of India's neighbors and demographic of refugees (especially illegal) India has been dealing with, this policy makes sense even if it is unfair. Look at Assam.

Because, like you said, Hindus aren't a minority. The protection is for minorities (religious and caste).

Sure, I can get behind that.

Except we don’t just cater to cherry-picked minorities, do we? The bill doesn’t include all nearby countries (Uyghurs in China), nor does it recognise any nuances (Rohingyas in Myanmar).

IIRC illegal immigrants in Assam consisted more of Hindus than Muslims. I’ll have to look up my source, but this policy doesn’t make sense even if you take that into account.

Mandal Commission wasn’t cherry picking minorities and their places.

And that was my precise point. That we accord special status to minorities. In this case, Hindu refugees being persecuted in another country constitute a minority in that country (and matter of fact, worldwide). And as a result, we accord them special status with specific rules to get into our country.

Laws actually do work that way. Refugees don't just sail a boat and hope the wind flies them to a random country. They go to a specific country that has the greatest chance of accepting them.

I too have a major issue with the bill being inconsistent in this regard. A better way to implement this would have been to have a list of specific people (across all religions) who are accepted into the country as refugees.

For some reason, people have started to think in very binary terms. Just because I am pointing some aspects of why the bill was put in place doesn't mean I agree with the bill entirely, or even agree with the party position or party policy.

From your own source :
In a 2018 report, United Nations Human Rights office expressed concerns over attacks directed at minorities and Dalits in India. The statement came in an annual report to the United Nations Human Rights Council's March 2018 session where Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said,

""In India, I am increasingly disturbed by discrimination and violence directed at minorities, including Dalits and other scheduled castes, and religious minorities such as Muslims. In some cases this injustice appears actively endorsed by local or religious officials. I am concerned that criticism of government policies is frequently met by claims that it constitutes sedition or a threat to national security. I am deeply concerned by efforts to limit critical voices through the cancellation or suspension of registration of thousands of NGOs, including groups advocating for human rights and even public health groups.""

fb3flz4,"**Religious violence in India**

Religious violence in India includes acts of violence by followers of one religious group against followers and institutions of another religious group, often in the form of rioting. Religious violence in India has generally involved Hindus and Muslims.Despite the secular and religiously tolerant constitution of India, broad religious representation in various aspects of society including the government, the active role played by autonomous bodies such as National Human Rights Commission of India and National Commission for Minorities, and the ground-level work being done by non-governmental organisations, sporadic and sometimes serious acts of religious violence tend to occur as the root causes of religious violence often run deep in history, religious activities, and politics of India.Along with domestic organizations, international human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch publish reports on acts of religious violence in India. Over 2005 to 2009 period, an average of 130 people died every year from communal violence, or about 0.01 deaths per 100,000 population. The state of Maharashtra reported the highest total number of religious violence related fatalities over that five-year period, while Madhya Pradesh experienced the highest fatality rate per year per 100,000 population between 2005 and 2009.

But in this sub, people repeatedly bring up beef incidents which is good. But then people are painting it as if the nation is crashing and burning and getting destroyed by communal violence.

No one argues that beef incidents has the same body count as that of Babri Masjid riots.  
Beef incidents are symptoms of a rising intolerance in the society. If unchecked it can fester into something terrible.

>So I tried finding facts and this surprised me. Since you too are quoting that article, then please also see the table of data. At a nation scale, communal violence has dropped dramatically over the last decade.


Finding facts is good. But without proper context facts are misleading.  As you very well know, depending on who is publishing the facts, either Indian airforce killed scores of Islamic terrorists or they hit a few pine trees across the border.

>So if you too feel the nation is burning, then please show proof in terms of numbers. Not just quoted about concerns.


I don't think the nation is burning. But 


(1) the government lacks transparency.  I am  talking about providing impartial hard data not propaganda. 

(2) the government encourages people like Amit Shah who are intentionally or maliciously divisive. 

(3)  When multiple independent groups sound the alarm about violation of human rights something is definitely broken. 

(4)  There are enough economic, climate, healthcare issues. When the government focusses more on citizenship tests rather than onion prices it is cause for concern. 

(5) When school textbooks  stop teaching facts and start talking about fiction it indicates indoctrination. BJP wants to build a cult not well informed society.",1,4,1576516643.0,omeow,False,negative,negative,negative,negative
