d573wp7,"Lot of posters here don't seem to have a clue about recent and older Indian construction techniques. 

The Shivaji stairs were hand carved out of stone using chisel and hammer. It probably took one mason 4-5 days to hew one stone. The same can be easily done today, by hand, but most people would not want to pay that kind of money. You could get the stone cut by machine. You wouldn't need much cement or lime once the stone is squared and cut-just the joints between.

You can produce the same lime as was used in the construction of Ancient Delhi, or the many forts, quite easily. But it takes a lot of labor and effort.

The 2013 stairs took about a day to build and the main reason for the cement flaking off is probably the cement to sand ratio was off. Typical correct ratio would be 5:1 or 6:1 sand to cement. The contractor may have stolen cement and may have used 8:1. And people walking on it before it was set.

Edit 1-Also the cement may not have been kept cool and hydrated with water during curing. ",45,0,1468186766.0,,1468188147.0,neutral,negative,neutral,neutral

d56t0mv,"This is absolute truth.

I kid you not, I have been to enormous amount of historical structures around India. That is what I used to do during studies and beyond. Almost all of them have a durability that will put any modern Indian construction to shame. Not just stairs, but anything from buttresses, roofs, fences (yes, stone ones) and the strength of walls themselves. And I am not even talking about forts (who would be intentionally be made of large blocks of fired clay and stone), but the usual buildings.

Heck, Fatehpur Sikri has a better fountain than what our governments build in gardens, if they do so at all.

It is a crying shame our government is not even able to build up to the standards of North Korea. PWD and ilk are the laziest and most incompetent organizations ever. Can't even hire trained quasi-literate labourers or learn to build a fucking staircase.

d56t1vc,"It does make one good point, I think.

Modern day politicians have a horizon of expectations for their policies to produce results that lasts for the duration of their term in office, at maximum.
They want their electorate to see marked improvement in quality of life within 5 years of election, so they can be associated with the achievements.

The problem is this system does not incentivize a perspective on development that extends into the long-term. Investments are not made that sacrifice a little bit now to receive more for future generations.

That's not to say every staircase should be built to last millenia or longer. We are working with finite resources and every investment has an opportunity cost. Stonework is expensive. Sometimes it might be better to put a little less into A when investing the difference into B gives you more bang for your buck.

Considering the picture is authentic, we must note that the one made in the times of Shivaji was made of blocks of **stone**, whereas the ones made in our time is made of **some sort of tile, a mere replica of stone**. In our time, we have learned the way to copy a design, mimic nature in it and make it better or more beautiful, but when it comes to copying the strength, we are far behind nature. This is true to everything in our life. We are more for image and less concerned about identity. About which Guy Debord wrote: 

***""Images detached from every aspect of life merge into a common stream, and the former unity of life is lost forever. Apprehended in a partial way, reality unfolds in a new generality as a pseudo­world apart, solely as an object of contemplation. The tendency toward the specialization of images­ of ­the world finds its highest expression in the world of the autonomous image, where deceit deceives itself. The spectacle in its generality is a concrete inversion of life, and, as such, the autonomous movement of non­life. ""***

d56njcd,"No tender is clean. It's often created, mapped, prepared and executed by the company and middleman willing to shell out the most to the bureaucrats and politicians. As simple. 

A sample process: 

1. Minister comes into power and cracks knuckles with closest aides. 
1. Consultants go around identifying companies who can reciprocate favours while possessing the ability to act as if something spectacular is happening.
1. Either the central idea of what the new project has to be is already present (based on a central/state govt commitment) or a new project proposed by said company and consultant will be approved by ministers in charge. 
1. By now, you understand that it is already pre-decided who is going to win the project and who is going to get paid for it.
1. Govt might assign the project management to one of other organisations like ECIL, BEL, NIC for eg.
1. Company allocates resources for working with govt officials or project officials (in case of consulting orgs) making technical and commercial specifications in-line with their own credentials. 
1. Companies lock in the project with manufacturers/OEMs/distributors to avail best prices automatically disqualifying the other companies on a purely commercial basis. The other companies only stand a chance now if their services components are very low and/or they don't add decent margins to the product sale. 
1. Based on the org and commercial size, it's either an open or a closed tender. The release of the RFP, tender and paper ads are managed by the company so as to attract the least number of eyes. 
1. Tender process comes into play - Product + % Margin (Topline), 2-4% for distributors, extremely overpriced services component (bottomline) + 15-20% cut for others involved + Taxes. To the govt that's already anywhere between 40 to 50% above market costs plus a mandatory 3-5% for the consulting organisations. 
1. Company gets favoured bureaucrats on executive committee by flexing financial muscle.
1. Company gets other prospectives disqualified either on compliance/price/qualification criteria. 
1. Company wins contract. Takes 50-90% of the payment as advance, in accordance with the tender they helped create.
1. Company goes back to manufacturers and arm-twists them into giving better price since they now have the PO in hand. 
1. Company doles out payouts. Ministers, middlemen and bureaucrats are now out of the picture.  
1. Company does whatever the fuck they want - under-deliver in quality, delay the project indefinitely, absolutely fucking whatever. 
1. Company parts with an extra 1-2% to random guys from consulting orgs for acceptance tests, finance processing, etc.
1. All iz well. 


If the company actually finishes the work with quality and timelines in mind, with just a 50% additional cost, that's your absolute best case scenario. Things have gone and often still go WAY HIGHER.",57,2,1468160009.0,kabuliwallah,1468160287.0,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral
d56xg7m,"> Do you really believe in lowest bidder thing? some of the government projects ballpark are more than three times of normal private company.

I do believe in lowest-bidder, but that's because I've seen how procurement works.

Due to past abuses and legislation, government entity sets rules for how procurement works.  These rules are usually an attempt to reduce abuse, and are reactionary to previous abuse.  These rules may cover things like ability to deliver in a timely fashion, materials quality or consistency, ability to follow licensing rules or insurance bonding, workplace safety, fair wage standards for employees (often called prevailing wage), and other things.  Sometimes depending on the nature of the work or the goods, other rules will also be added.  Once the rules are written (often called a Request For Quote (RFQ) or Request For Proposal (RFP)) then companies are publicly invited to submit proposals to be the chosen vendor, often the exclusive vendor, for whatever time period is described in the solicitation.

Companies will evaluate the solicitation and determine if they meet it, or could meet it, or if they want to try to meet it even if they really don't know if they can or not.  Companies then send in the submissions, which are reviewed by the purchasing agents for the government entity.  Those purchasing agents sometimes have the authority to make the decision even if they're not personally knowledgeable about the business at-hand, other times they'll consult with the agency that is responsible for it, and in yet other cases the agency will decide, and the purchasing agent merely signs-off on the deal.

Now, the tricky part is if the RFQ/RFP was really written right or not, if the evaluation of the submission was done right and caught any deficiencies, and if the government as the buyer enforces the terms of the agreement when deficiencies are discovered.

If a particular vendor doesn't really know what they're doing but somehow manages to put together a submission that looks good on paper and undercuts everyone else then they may be chosen, after all, why would the purchasing agent spend more for the same result?  Trouble is since people often want to think the best of others they are not suitably skeptical, they do not reject proposals that are nonviable, and the company awarded the job ends up with some problem attempting to fulfill it.  That problem could be an inability to deliver on-time, an inability to meet a volume-count, an inability to maintain quality in the work, etc.

I've personally had to deal with this, I've inspected contractor work and rejected it enough that at times I'm known as the East German Judge.  If I find something that doesn't match our standards disclosed at the start I'm not going to pass it, and honestly I don't care if the vendor loses money by having to pay their employees to redo the work.  As far as I'm concerned it's the company's job to hire one good PM that actually would talk to me at the outset to confirm the standard to which the work is expected and would want to check the work as the project proceeds to stop problems while they're small.  It's not my responsibility to structure their company.

Based on what I've found it's clear that some vendors in the past were allowed to do bad work.  As far as I'm concerned that's not acceptable now, I don't care if the whole building is messed up, the new work will be done right even if it's the only work done right.

So looking at this stair job, it's likely that the government picked the wrong materials or trusted the vendor to pick the materials, and has failed to enforce any sort of warranty on the work.  The vendor's bond should be pulled and the job given to someone else to fix it or replace it outright.  Given how it doesn't match the character of what's already there, rip it out and start over with something that looks like it belongs.",11,2,1468176869.0,Donkey__Xote,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

So if a public function is getting built, hospital, a bridge or a library, that kind of stuff this is what happens. First the local authorities do the drawings, stipulate quality checks, schedule expected maintenance and all the rest of it. They then have a plan for the project including all these documents, probably around 1000 pages. This plan is then offered publicly for any company that wants to have a go. This plan is circulated among construction companies and the one who offers the lowest bid, wins the contract. Because it's funded with taxpayers money, all of these documents and transactions are publicly available though usually it's just the newspapers skimming through them and writing a piece if they find anything suspicious.

I'm in engineering for a public agency (irrigation) and I've been really learning a ton recently about public procurement -- in fact just went through the bid opening of an RFQ not too long ago.   I love your talk about inspecting contractor work and denying substandard work.  The inspector where I work that's been there for a good awhile now has a reputation for his attention to detail and willingness to turn things away if they don't meet our clearly stated requirements.  The contractors don't mess with him.  On a recent project he turned away multiple concrete trucks that didn't meet requirements. 

 Apparently before he was here there was a distinct ""old boys club"" culture in the company and in it's relationship with certain contractors.  People with close ties to those on the board of directors or other management would get preferential treatment and do substandard work.  Continually to this day we have to deal with maintenance and other quality issues due to those oversights decades ago.  

I'm still fairly new to all of this public agency laws/regulations stuff, but it's been a very enlightening experience so far.

That could be because of he lack of know-how or he absence of technology that allows a modern engineer to tailor his products to whatever specifications are desired. 

Over-design is never a good thing. It costs resources that could have been better spent elsewhere, and and it also costs time and money to modify/dismantle/demolish once it ceases to be of use. One of the very few cases it makes sense is in an object that is likely to see war, and has to withstand what the enemy can throw at it. So forts were obviously ""over-designed"" so that they could take attacks from projectile weapons and still stay standing. But a temple... not so much.

Well, he couldn't.  We required BISCI compliance and industry standards.  We get to a jobsite and they don't even know how to install a wire manager, they're trying to use the patch cable wire manager to organize the horizontal cable that's punched-down on the back of the patch panel.  They weren't pulling cable in with any logical order, they were pulling all and terminating all then testing to label where it went, so a 6-port wallplate would have random cable numbers on it, and not even in numeric order.  They didn't even have a proper certification tester and wanted to give us test results that were handwritten even though the standards docs requires use of a Level 4 tester and electronic notes in that test-equipment vendor's native format.

The sad thing was even with all of this what it finally took to kick them off was their spending enough to exhaust the contingency fund set aside without asking, and then asking for more money on top of it.  I think that they were denied the contingency money seeing as how it required asking for it on-paper and required our signing-off on-paper, were kicked off the job, and then were essentially backcharged for all labor costs they'd billed as we had to redo it.  We didn't backcharge for materials because a lot of it was reusable but we probably could have gotten a few thousand for cabling back as they pulled some cables so short that they had to be repulled.

The improvement in quality of life is an excellent example of how society has evolved to best care for itself. It is an example of how our technological abilities have objectively progressed.

We can progress, objectively, on a technological level. Technology, now, is objectively better than older technology. In turn this has provided contemporary society with luxuries never before seen in human history. 

Our technological ability is not an indicator of a more developed society. Humans are fundamentally the same as always. We are as capable of cruelty as we were in the sixteenth century. 

People incorrectly believe our technological and scientific ability is an indication of a more-enlightened, progressive society. They see societal change as a straight line of progressive improvement because that is generally what is seen in technology and science. That's not how humans work.
