gltvs1f,"> Well as a anointed bhakt, I promise that if Congress get a non Gandhi leader I will vote for Congress.

No Gandhi has been in any govt for more than 3 decades. MMS was and will remain one of the best PMs India has ever had, both in terms of economy & foreign affairs. The narrative about him being chaperoned is absolute bunkum created by the godi media, the chaperoning was from the NAC. Of course, as a non-elected PM, he derived his legitimacy from the backing of the party leader and there is nothing wrong in it. It is beyond obvious that he was a man of his own and has built a lasting legacy for himself.

The bit about NAC, it was a fantastic idea that provided a voice to technocrats and civil society and was the moving force behind for perhaps the two best pieces of legislation in the last 30 years, the Right to Information Act and the MNREGA.

Dont fall for the BS that all these clueless godi media opinion peddlers write on behalf of their PR handlers. Use your own brain and sit down and analyse what has happened.

Anyway, what is your problem with the Gandhis now? What have they taken away from you that you hate them? They didn't appoint themselves as heads of BCCI or any other lucrative money machines. If anything, of all the major political families, including most around the world, their conduct has been exemplary.
