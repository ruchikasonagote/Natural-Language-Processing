5 kg raw mangoes 
250 g fennel seeds (saunf)
100 g fenugreek seeds (methi dana)
250 g yellow mustard seeds (sarson)
50 g nigella seeds (kalonji)
50 g carom seeds (ajwain)
100 g red chili powder
100 g turmeric powder (haldi)
1 kg salt (adjust as per taste)
1 g asafoetida (heeng)
1 teaspoon sugar
1 kg mustard oil


Method:

Choose firm, unripe mangoes with little to no blemishes
Start with thoroughly washing the mangoes and letting them dry completely. Or use a dry cloth to wipe the mangoes
After the mangoes have dried completely, cut the mangoes into bite-sized cubes, and discard the seeds
Spread the cut mango pieces on a clean cloth and keep it in bright sunlight for 3-4 hours (to dry out any lingering moisture)
Dry roast the fennel seeds (saunf) and fenugreek seeds (methi dana) at low to medium heat till fragrant. Let it cool. Then coarsely grind the fennel seeds and fenugreek seeds in a spice blender (or mortar and pestle)
Coarsely grind the yellow mustard seeds (sarson) without dry roasting
Now, in a big, wide mouthed utensil (should be large enough for the mangoes and the masala), mix the salt, the ground spices (fennel seeds, fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds) and other dry spices (red chili powder, turmeric powder, nigella seeds, carom seeds)
Add the now dried mango cubes in the pickle masala and mix very well
Pour in half of the mustard oil in the mango and masala mix
Next, heat 2 tablespoon of mustard oil and add asafoetida (heeng) to the hot oil. Let it cool
Now put the mango and masala mix in a clean and dry ceramic or glass jar, and pour the heeng oil (make sure it has cooled down) and the remaining mustard oil in the jar
In the end, just add one teaspoon of sugar over the pickle
Cover the jar with a muslin cloth, and keep it in bright sunlight for 1 week for the flavors to develop. Make sure to stir the pickle every day for that one week
