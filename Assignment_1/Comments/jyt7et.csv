It might be worth checking with lawyers if there is a possibility of a class action lawsuit. If all parents who were cheated by this company come together to sue, that is a bigger threat to their model and they might rescind their defamation suit, which does not have much ground to stand on in the first place.

##What is White Hat Jr. about?

An ed-tech startup based in India that was acquired by $300M by BYJUS, another ed-tech startup using predatory marketing techniques.

##Why the hate?

[Misleading ads like these](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ec5DtiuXsAIekFa.jpg) and promising parents that their 10 yo can be turned into competent coders and charging them as high as $1500 for coaching classes. All the shit they sell is freely available on the internet. Worst part- their trainers are not even from programming background and know diddlysquat about coding.

##Who is OP?

Whistleblower who exposed all their fraudulent marketing tactics. White Hat Jr. has engaged in bullying of whistleblowers. Check OP's entire reddit profile.

#Since the post has hit front page, this is a reference for all non-Indians. 


**In Indian numbering system**

1 crore = 1,00,00,000 aka 10,000,000

so 20 crore = 200,000,000 

**Current USD to INR conversion**- 

1 USD= INR 74.16

therefore

INR 200M = USD 2,696,775.20

2.5M may seem measly to some but it is a friggin huge amount in India.

gd98yyu,"As this is gone on r/all here's a tldr:

There's this new company in India that aims to teach coding to children aged around 8. They advertise about multiple 8 year olds getting 1mil+ jobs and opening startups all over media.  

Moreover the teachers employed dont know even the very basics of programming and put the kid through very base and harsh environment leading to children being visibly affected, so parents by their right ask for this to be resolved and/or be refunded. But there has been a clear lack of proper resolution or even response from the company.   


They have actively removed any bad feedback from playstore reviews, and gotten multiple people banned over other social media platforms for raising their voice and asking for refunds. The indian courts asked them to remove 1-2 of their ads but the underlying scheme of making money remains the same.


Infact a massive amount of fake bought out reviews can be seen all over the internet. With different forms of mass marketing, the parents are still getting fooled in huge numbers. And all the negative noise is being buried under the ground. 


The OP has been actively collecting proof and raising his voice since many months now. But most news media have refused to take up the story. Finally after very long OP found out about their open slack channels, because these guys never knew about password protecting their internal slack systems. After months of abusing the OP and trying to bury his voice they have now raised a legal defamation case of 2.6mil against him. And he is ready to fight. The only hope now is probably international media and or financial support and guidance from more knowledgeable folks.

For context absolute top tier Supreme Court senior lawyers charge 25 lakhs per hearing. Reasonably good ones will easily charge 10-12 lakhs per hearing. Even 'reasonable' top grade lawyers will charge 3-4 lakhs for just one hearing. This is just their fees, it does not cover various court fees, documentation or any other expenses that may be incurred as part of the process. There is no way you can crowdsource  that sort of money.

If this was just some random civil dispute between individuals then you could have found reasonably good lawyers but a large organization like WHJ will field a top notch legal team and feel good Jolly LLB vibes aside, there is no way you're coming out ahead unless you have comparable legal muscle in your camp.

Secondly, in my view, the objective need not necessarily be to win this case but to get as much bad publicity for whitehat as possible and you are successful to a great extent already. If fighting this case is the only way you can continue to post videos exposing whitehat, then so be it.

If however fighting the case means you have to stay silent about whitehat, then id suggests exploring some other options.

If you decide to fight the case, then Pradeep you MUST Start a fundraiser.

1. Set a goal of raising around 10 lakh rupees. That's 1000 rs avg from 1000 ppl. A bit ambitious but not crazy. I imagine it will cover you for 10-12 months with a decent lawyer. 
2. Having an open litigation will also worry Whitehat BYJU because they will have to disclose it to all potential future investors. So don't think they have nothing to lose. Investors hate dealing with companies in a legal mess
3. I'll donate 5000 myself. Some other people have mentioned here they will donate as well

Alternatively you can simply let them keep fighting in court and all you have to do is just not attend the proceedings but make it clear that you’re contesting the claims and just offer one time written claims to take into consideration.

What do you know about the inner details of the company? They know all of your details.

Do you have time and resources to fight against them? They have plenty of it.

What does it matter to you if you win the case? Nothing, except for some internal ego satisfaction fot the removed posts. But what if you lose (i wish not to happen)? But on theirs side, if they lose, they have resources to do other business to sustain their life, if they win, that's like a strong warning for others saying not to mess with them.

And the people who are supporting by sharing the op's posts, it so kind of you to support the one who is in need, but are you guys willing to take the hit if such case is filed against everyone who is involved in the social media threads? Do you have any solid proof to trust op or go against the company, or are you guys the victims of their *false* advertisements? Are you guys ready to spend your time and resources if such kind of notice comes to you? 

Every single thing whith the op's fight against the company is wrong. He should have filed a case, but instead he came on social media defaming the company. Yes, it's called defaming. Not *reviewing*. If you have bought their subscription and are not satisfied with what you're getting, you have to talk to their support team and if that doesn't work, you can post your experience on internet where it is accepted. But most of you guys are not the users/victims and are talking negative about it. How fair is it. 

The most silly thing is even an experienced YouTuber like jim browning hides his identity when fighting against small scan call centres, but op kept all his details open when fighting with a big company. There are some legal procedures to fight against something and it is not posting about it on internet. Hope IITs teach it.

I've been there myself; and [I actually had all the legal evidence, including court documents proving my experience of being harassed for criticizing a computer game, and the developers supporting that to try and shut down said critics.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfzXS-H5SzM)  The problem is, unless you've *already* gone viral, or it's a story that might, even if you find a sympathetic reporter, it's rare for an Editor to commission the actual story because in this 24 hour news cycle, they want maximum bang for buck. 

It's *not* that your story isn't interesting, or that what is being done to you isn't an injustice, only that it's not something the media thinks they can *sell* to enough people to make it worth more than what ever even worse things are happening right now.

And then you've got to be able to pitch the story well yourself to even be heard; Apparently you did, but how many victims of injustice can write well enough to catch a reporters eye? Take pride that this includes you, but even a genius is still fighting against the power of Money.

I personally had plenty of interested mainstream media; Ars Technica, Kotaku, Eurogamer all liked my pitch... but unfortunately the game involved is largely dead and abandoned, the company developing it has since gone bankrupt, so why bother?

However, now you have this thread gaining some traction, writing *again* to the media and pointing out that you're starting to go viral might help. You're able to prove there's an *audience* for your story out there.

And also... stay personally strong. I know it's exhausting, but this is one of the main qualities of evil. The evil can't really *create*, so they just destroy, destroy, destroy in the hopes that eventually they'll wear out those who want something better for the world.   But we need good people to keep trying for there to be anything good actually out there...

There will come a point though where it's just not worth personally trying, because good takes work, where as being a scamming bastard takes no effort at all; so the cost to you personally becomes too much.  That's just being human in a world built for monsters. I cannot say when that will be for you; for me it was when I proved in legal form said company didn't even have a legal EULA.  My stalker still turns up now *6 years* later obsessing about me, even after he helped bankrupt the company he thought he was defending. 

I still won though. And here and now, you've done some good. And it's good enough.

Can the Redditor be protected under whistleblower act?

I don't think that the Redditor can do anything about comments/ videos being taken down. If he wants to contest against the comments being taken down, then he would have to track the people who posted them, and ask them to come out in open justifying that their views are being suppressed which is against their rights. Again, if they are deleted by Youtube/ Facebook, then it adds additional overhead because he would have to prove that these taking down of comments violates these platform's own policies, and thus encourages further cheating tactics by the startup. In this case Facebook/ Youtube would also be considered accused as they are the ones who deleted them against their own policies. Thus, you would have to deal with their lawyers too.

Now comming for videos that have been taken down. The part where the Redditor justifies that the instructors are unqualified, and that they are giving wrong knowledge by showing recording of live webinar sessions cannot be contested. The startup would be completely within its rights to sue him since he showed their content for free which otherwise is not free and would require people to pay for.  I am 100% sure this would be in the startup's policy.

No matter how useless that content would be. The content being useless is from the redditor's point of view, and not universal. Think this in parallel to a coaching institute or a school. The teachers teaching there may teach whatever they want for a specific topic like an English pronunciation class. The only thing for the parents here is to unenroll their child from the classes and ask for refund. Again, refunds would be subject to the classes policy which the parents would have agreed at the time of paying the fees.

I'll can't talk much as it'll be a severe risk to me and family but here what I can tell you. Dad works for a very powerful person. Can't tell much about his details. But here's what he told me.

Most of these so called startup who had a very inorganic growth including the one you are having issues are just money laundering fronts. Their owners are not your average online scammers instead in govt politicians and top businessmen and the primary aim of these startups are money laundering and transfer to foreign wealth. They are backed by politicians, businessmen and a shitload of your smart people working for them. They own the law, the media and whatever else

You are not bringing knife to a gunfight, you are bringing knife to a aerial drone fight.

So unless you have actual power like a politician/businessman relative, shitload of money, can run to another country anytime then continue but if you are fighting solely based on courage, with no money or actual power, I'd dearly suggest you  to settle the matter.

These internet medals, upvotes, etc won't matter shit if anything bad happens to you. I am not threatening you. I am just telling you what you are up against and what's at risk. They fight dirty. After a level laws don't matter. You're not fighting a usual low key scammer, you are against the people who run the country. Atleast prepare yourself before entering such a messy fight. You won't win this with donations. You need actual power and resources.

Your links and proofs don't mean shit, If they really started fighting your social media accounts will go down in a day. Links will show errors. Proofs will be termed fake. Media will talk against you. People will threaten you. Fake screenshots will appear.

Do you have time and money to prove that wrong. Do you know how much it costs to get forensics report to prove a photo fake.
Do you have resources to get your accounts back. Have a dead man's switch. Social media handlers who will handle comments so that you won't be arrested over emotional tweets and posts. And those chat screenshots in your previous post where you said that they are threatening you, with a good lawyer those can be use AGAINST you. 'AAJA' and 'DEKH LUNGA' that's not how things work in real life bro.

You are not fighting WHJ, That's the first thing for you to understand.

Think the worst that could happen. If you are ready to accept it only then move forward. Not a single person pseudopraising and being a keyboard warrior will actually prioritise you over themselves and their safety if they get dragged down in it too. It's your fight. Don't let online comments affect your decisions

If anyone wanna ask anything, unless it risks my safety, I'll answer it. And to those who are downvoting, tell your reason otherwise you too are just a keyboard warrior making him overconfident",10,0,1606103863.0,cooltechpec,1606110978.0,negative,neutral,negative,negative

Lets all resolve to tell all the parents (who'll listen to us) in our network, 
**""Kids don't need to learn coding""**.


May be some concepts of logical thinking and abstractions and stuff but not coding. These can be learnt from real resources like Khan Academy or learning from an actual instructor who knows their stuff. 


Don't take away their freedom by making them sit in front of a computer and code away to no meaningful end. I'd say it is probably detrimental in the long run. 


I am saying this as a parent (and educator) who develop lots of software for myself, and I have a 7yr old precocious kid who is really good at math and analytical thinking. The only thing I teach him is fundamentals through physical activities (think tower of Hanoi with rings). We explored MIT Scratch but I believe its too early. Instead, teach them spatial awareness skills. Let them learn to juggle. Kick a ball around the house. Jump over the furniture. Play with friends and learn negotiation and team building.

gdjl5sa,"Hey Pradeep,

I got a notification about your situation and I was glad that there was some detailed coverage being done on the case. I was however very disappointed to see the same situation downplayed to its lowest of the low in mainstream media. There was a 100-250 word article in Times of India which treated it as a nothing.

I think its time to up the game now. As you've realised by now mainstream media is biased. Sab paiso ka khel hain. 

I don't this will actually work, I think you should also enlist the help of your followers and supporters. You should ask your followers to contact Youtubers and Social Media Influencers and request them to bring this matter to their attention and get them involved and make videos/articles about it. 

Again, sab media bika hua hain, not sure how will that pan out, or how many youtubers/influencers will be willing to help you out.

I still think donations are the best! try to use https://99pledges.com/ or https://www.donatekindly.org/ or https://www.gofundme.com/ and one of the platforms to set up a donation page.

PLEASE READ TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU SET UP ONE UP, as most of them tend to charge a lumpsum amount of donations as their fee or a transaction charge per donation.

gdaz5k2,"I appreciate your comment and I believe that the OP should be aware that the final outcome 'might' not be in his favour. It's a tough road ahead. 

This case is somewhat similar to Maheshwer Peri vs IIPM, which Mr Peri won. Unfortunately, the case took a huge toll on Mr Peri's life and he was harrassed, intimidated and abused by the IIPM owner. The court cases cost him more than 1 Crore (Rs. 10 Million) and he had to deal with cases filed in North East against him, even though he was living in Delhi. Also, Mr Peri was a wealthy person (he was the CEO of Careers360) but still it took him years to win his case (and that too at a massive cost). 

Mr Poonia doesn't seem to have resources to deal with a company that is much bigger and influential than IIPM. Reddit donations might not work.

As far as I am aware, he has already been contacted by some lawyers. I hope the lawyers advice him well on this case. If he and his lawyers want, they can go ahead with filing a counter-suit and allege harassment from the plaintiff, but it's definitely a rocky road ahead and Mr Poonia needs to be mentally prepared for what's coming. He may win as well (just like how Mr Peri won), but this win is going to come at a ""huge"" cost.

They had been removing all criticisms that OP or anyone else put on any websites by mass reporting with bots and fake accounts.

When OP started collecting this evidence he started getting harassed by their employees including one of their higher-ups who said  she'll file a harassment case against him. He got banned on LinkedIn/Youtube/Quora because of mass-reporting.

OP posted screenshots of their slack channel showing how they strategize their shady business practices. You can also check his post history.

Poonia has made several videos on whole a whole side team of WHJ is there to target any dissent and pull it down.
