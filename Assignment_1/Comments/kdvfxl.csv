gfzf4we,"The is not the India ""that is meant to be""... This is the India they don't want us to see... 

Increasing communal tensions and news of fanatic (read 'pathetic') individuals has made us believe that the fanatics are the norm

Most of India is like this... They just don't want us to see random acts of kindness, regardless of faith... they don't want us to believe that 95% of the country is comprised of good people, showing everyday kindness to everyone.",1088,0,1608080721.0,modinotmodi,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

gg0pl84,"This is how I‚Äôve always seen India as. 

When it comes to religion, I‚Äôve grown up in a Catholic neighbourhood in Mumbai. Only one Muslim family among us and as a child I remember sitting with this family when they would break their fast during Ramadan. They had a big thaali with fruits, dried fruits and nuts and they would all sit around and eat it together. I was always welcome and the aunty used to feed me as well. At least 3-4 times a week I was part of their ritual because I was great friends with the kids. Till date they send us biryani on various occasions. 

Meanwhile in school my best friend (till date) is Hindu. We used to stay over at each other‚Äôs places and grew so close. She would come with me to church and I used to explain what was happening. I would go with her for puja and she would explain stuff to me. They included me in all their religious celebrations. I‚Äôve been to so many dandiya nights and visarjans and felt very included every single time. My parents didn‚Äôt get outraged and hers didn‚Äôt either. 

Today, people are filled with hate and hatred is promoted more than anything. People are outraging on social media because a bunch of cops were recorded in Santa hats while eating cake. They‚Äôve been abused for something as asinine as that. A hat and cake. 
Not to mention, Santa hats (and other Christmas related stuff) are sold on the streets by little children in the month of December.

Like always, the privileged class decides what narratives to push, they decide who is patriotic, national or anti-national. And many of these conservatives (not pinning on any one religion) are happy calling for genocide, smirking behind their computer screens, as if they did something exemplary to protect their so called ""religious/cultural"" identity. Because when you idiots wage war, you perfectly well know that it's the poor who die. 



The conservatives force pride, for whatever culture they belong to, down their throats, a culture they had no contribution in building, their pride is the only thing that gives them confidence, because of the validation they get from their echo chamber.

Much of India is like this‚Ä¶ where people do not want to see us see random acts of kindness, regardless of faith. They do not want us to believe that 95% of the country is made up of good people. 

Some Muslim communities in India and other religions likewise have been fed with so much hatred that they see themselves as oppressed people and are ready to fight.

On the other hand, communal politics has always been a part of India. Minor appeasement has always been the status quo of the Congress while the BJP goes to the other end. The Hindu Mahasabha was against Pakistan during the freedom struggle and wanted a united India. Both BJP and Congress thrive on hate and division. This is the sad truth of our country.

3. A Mind Full Of Thoughts About Money Cannot Concentrate Nor Meditate

>Try to understand your religion first.  
>  
>""The Quran narrates the story of the ""people of Lot"" destroyed by the wrath of God because the men engaged in lustful carnal acts between themselves""

Understanding my religion is a work in progress for me, but your attitude of knowing it all reeks of ignorance.  
Your example serves to prove what I've been arguing - divine punishments, in general, do not directly serve as a scriptural basis for specific temporal punishments under Islamic law- it may convey that that activity is disapproved.  
By that standard, Abraha (a Christian monotheist king before the prophet), who was out to destroy the Kaa'ba, then used for polytheistic activities, suffered divine punishment. But few would use this as a basis to conclude that desecrating polytheistic temples could be a punishable crime in sharia (though there are [other](https://quran.com/6/108), better grounds for that).   
As for homosexuality itself, it's criminalisation and penalisation is a matter of debate in Muslim societies, while it's widely regarded as socially and religiously unacceptable. Fun fact: the Ottoman 'Caliphate' decriminalised it in 1858 (>100 years before UK).  
It all depends on the social perceptions on the acceptability of an act, balance between personal liberty and social norms, and what constitutes a crime against society and the social fabric. There is no universal viewpoint on the social propriety of actions, which can be used to judge a society's progressive or regressive nature. Maybe in the future, consensual incest and drug abuse would be legal and socially acceptable in some places, and its prohibition would be used to characterise other societies as backward. It's a question of where societies and value systems draw the line, and Islam has a relatively strict one, forbidding all intercourse outside marriage and consumption of addictive substances.

>So if the forensic evidence does not support the claims of the four witnesses, do yo still kill the innocent person?

I don't know how this is dealt with, though there's a chance that the witnesses who made false accusations would be punished. 

>Now again why do you support such a violent religion

Considering that my religious activities don't involve any violence, nor do those of an incredibly large number of Muslims, there is a fair chance that you are mischaracterizing Islam, or alternatively, the large majority of Muslims aren't good Muslims. [This debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy9tNyp03M0) is a good starting point for a fact check.

Islamic values provide the basis for a plethora of politico-legal systems and Islam is hardly unique in that aspect as religions without political organisation (especially a decentralised one like Islam) were historically vulnerable to persecution. However, Islamic systems are unique in that they have endured and are still used by around half of the 50+ Muslim majority countries.

Islamic systems (excluding the wildly fanatic terrorist ones, which are exceptions rather than the rule)  are perhaps as violent at the core as any other system which is based on the monopoly of violence, unless you count anarchy as one. There are varying degrees of violence in the various systems, ranging from Turkey to Tunisia to Kuwait to Saudi Arabia. Also, if you notice, the stricter systems tend to coincide with authoritarian governments, which are more controlling (e.g Venezuela, North Korea) and conservative and in case of Islamic countries, often draw legitimacy and support from influential orthodox ulama by implementing their viewpoints.

True, there are components of core Islamic values and law which appear excessive when viewed from a hyper-liberal paradigm, but they, more often than not, stem from (or are exacerbated by) social prejudices endemic within societies.  Islam is not always liberal, nor is it pacifistic. But conversely, it isn't necessarily absolutist or violent. Legal points, doctrines and punishments are often contested among scholars and different schools of *fiqh* (and outside those schools, considering the loss of popularity of *taqlid*).

Try to view things in context, rather than from a simplistic and orientalist bias.

If you go by that logic a person doesn't needs any guidance in his life. He can learn everything from his experience may it be basic maths or communication. The lessons can be summed up in a line or two but have been discussed in depth in the book. These are the experiences of past that have been passed down to future so that it acts as guidance and possibly make less mistakes than they did. 

>Is Geeta the only text for Hindus, have you read the others like manusmriti?


I've tried out of my interest but Hindu scriptures are way too vast and varied to go through. Did you use word manusmriti instead of scriptures because Dr. Ambedkar burnt them? You can google what was it to understand how manusmriti was essentially not part of the scriptures.I agree it has played a major role in shaping our society but now it doesn't hold that much significance over us.


>The Gita has been cited and criticized as a Hindu text that supports varna-dharma and the caste system. 


Dr. Ambedkar was an highly intellectual man the likes of which this country will ever see again. He criticized both Islam as well as Hinduism with all the correct points as he went through those injustices personally in his life. But if you want forget all the religions and are using his words as your justification you need to remember he too converted to Buddhism. He too had an religious identity to himself. You can criticize aspects of every religion. But discarding the whole book isn't the solution. You need to build solution upon soils of the past and move forward. Caste discrimination has been eliminated in our constitution and is punishable by law. But people still tend follow it. The solution isn't to discard the books. The solution would be to implement the law more severely and instill the lesson of equality in the future generation. When people's mindset is groomed in that way from early age, there won't be any external forces such as politicians that can shift them back to the dogmas you are speaking about.

>So that is your whole point, caste discrimination and sati is ok in Hinduism because its better than Islam?


My point is our country has banned blasphemy which itself is a example of scraping the bad practices. I'm not pointing out if any religion is better than other. I'm just pointing out we are coexisting with other religions by removing bad practices (whichever religion it belongs to) for the society for mutual benefits and peace. 

>People wont kill each other and discriminate in the name of God.


People are very gullible lmao. It's not God they kill for. They kill when they are told their identity is being threatened.

You are just getting rid of years lf knowledge, even if some of it is wrong and can be improved upon. Human civilisation will be back to square one in terms of progress.

Are you an idiot? First of all you think people who support religion do not have any moral understanding of human society. Second you feel law doesn't help anyone? A lawless society is where both religion and science will exploit anything they find, be it the innocent children or a poor elderly. Even if people do not respect the law they need to fear it. It's the only way you have a somewhat morally functioning society. There needs be to a be punishment for all the wrong doings and laws are the only thing that can make sure criminals get that without being biased. Though in real world people do not respect law but that's because they are able to get away with such things easily. I said it needs to be implemented more severely. What exactly do you think it wouldn't solve??

>There you go, so you are not religious you are just a hypocrite


Smh again you feel you can justify discarding religious books by calling me hypocrite because I do not blindly follow everything written in it. Fyi even atheists have been accepted in Hinduism. That's how deep the religions have been fleshed out. But you would rather not study it because well you have assumed they do not have anything to provide you that you can't already learn by yourself. Great mathematicians and scientists such as Ramanujan were religious. Would you still call them brainwashed and hypocrite and that they had no contribution to world? It's you who are blinded and brainwashed to believe that people who support religion do not have brain of their own and can not comprehend how a society functions or should function.

>Only FSM is the most powerful God, all other gods worship FSM.


Yeah go ahead, disregard the findings of people who came before us just because you can't believe religion and progress in human society have always coexisted.


>Have you, you have not even seen your imaginary god. LOL


Have you seen human evolving from apes? Well science claims so but have you seen it from your own eyes? There are lot of things science believes too. But you'd have faith in those things just because science said it right? Having faith in things is an important human characteristics that has helped human progress in all fields. It gives humans motivation to chase things that essentially don't exist till proven. And I thought we were talking about what importance books have for us, not about one's faith.

>You dont need religion for that, lol. 


Yet it existed scriptures or learning of our past and is connected to religious findings. Are these books but not history?

The terrorists you talk about are also controlled by people who crave for power in this world. Do not dare to narrow the business of terrorism to just religion. Terrorism thrives on every business may it be selling drugs in name of depression or pop culture or causing chaos in society in name of revolution or arm dealings in war in name of peace or prostitutions or be it vasooli. You take away religion and you do not cure even a bit of terrorism because at the end it's a human exploiting human for his own greed for whatever reason he can use to justify his actions.

If all diseases were incurable why does Ayurveda exists? Clearly they didn't just took name of God and give people medicine. Humans were around on earth lot more than 2020 years dude and to think that they did not even have idea of any aspect of life is just being ignorant to evolution of humans itself. What is modern medicine but combination of components you find in nature? Just because we have better understanding of world doesn't mean those people did not acknowledge it or did not even have any idea about it. There are detailed vedas written on every aspect of life ranging from maths , psychology, governance to astronomy, biology and warfare. These are detailed studies and accounts of history that you want to get rid of just because you think people were brainwashed and never contributed to society. There lot of things of past that modern science marvels at and can't yet explain and you still feel that the history of these things do not matter because science is your answer to everything. Science has progressed in places because of religions too and you just want to accept it.

>Now you get it, just like you are being controlled, the only difference is you dont kill others.


I could say the same for you. Aren't you being controlled by the education you have been exposed to in your life which has not taught you importance and achievements of earlier civilisations ?  Nazi's experimented on humans for science and progess. You don't. Don't you see the factor of individual's freedom at play here?

>Why do you want to respect those findings when they are wrong, you also disregard caste discrimination, why dont you respect that. You cannot pick and choose.

That's what the greatest thing about humans. We have enough understanding to pick and choose. That's what makes us different than millions of species on this planet. And if good and bad is subjective, wouldn't that make right and wring subjective too? Like seriously you are just contradicting yourself here. Caste system was essentially a system define categorisation and not rigid division in a society. People were allowed to change profession and gain knowledge. But someone at some point of history came and changed the interpretation so that it favours certain classes of society more. It transformed into something it wasn't originally meant to be. And what history saw was a dark era because humans chose to interpret and manipulated something they read in religious book as per their convenience and fooled everyone. That's my point. Books are not at fault, humans are. We humans have the ability to pick and choose and as well as form our own reasoning around something so that it meets our requirements. Books don't bring up the suffering, humans do. I cannot justify or change what happened in the history but I can only choose to not repeat those mistakes by understanding history. Without history you or maybe not you but someone else will come along to create similar scenario in the world again. Hence it matters that religious books to be understood entirely, both it's right and wrong aspects as per time and society. When you remove the bad components as part religious book you'll be passing on little knowledge. And little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

>Yes you can see that by looking at the bones. Have you seen your god?

It hasn't been proven yet though. You can only see similarities. Rest are just theories. We haven't seen it. We are just trying fill in the missing pieces by believing they are the right pieces for our sake. We completely new species other than apes. Or we both might have same ancestors. It's all a theory. Concept of God too is like that.  We pray a lot and give offerings to Nature via concept of God. It can be Sun, Rain, Earth, Woman, Scholars, Cow. We respect them because they are the reason we are alive. Just the way we believe in gravity though it's invisible. It lot deeper than you are assuming it to be. The phenomenon of bing bang is expressed as Brahama as God of creation. If Brahaman really existed, idk but we believe. Did bing bang really happen? We don't know, we haven't seen it yet we believe it might have. Things of past aren't as superficial as you think.

>Then why are you afraid to admit that you are a hypocrite?

If the religion is even accepting atheists dude it obviously is complex enough to accept other such cases. So for the religion I support I am not a hypocrite as you are continuously calling me. It itself says change is constant. It has well enough understanding of how varied people's thoughts are.

>dumbass, then you end up with people like your terrorist friends who think killing people is good because good and bad is subjective. Sleep over this main point, you will achieve enlightenment when you understand.

First of all you do not want laws in place. Second you feel      giving the half truth is better for humanity than giving the whole truth with facts and it's impact in history. Then you want peaceful society. Like seriously dude do you think people will stop killing once you get rid of religion part in it? Don't you see how simple it is to sway people to path of killing given the proper situation? People will kill in name of peace, land, rights, a public figure (like Dr. Ambedakar), food, drugs, science, desires, love, lust, fun, money, power, life, survival and many more. The religious books are not to blame for how corrupt a human mind can get. Look at the nuclear blasts in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It too can be considered a milestone in science but at what cost? Rather than eradicating part of the problem it's more important to create a generation with proper understanding of world and entirety of it and explain them what can go wrong and how not to repeat history.

Again neglecting that religion has lead to progress in science. The people who made those practiced religion as way of their life. Their education and qualifications were on par of today's scholars. We lay our respect to life and world around us via the concept of God. Just because you deny it's existence doesn't mean you are superior or inferior than those do.

But you can't see it so it doesn't exist according to your argument.

97% isn't 100%. Even if it was 100% it can't be proven. It'd only be a deduction. To prove it you'd have to study orangutangs with hope that he and his coming generations evolve into us. That's what would be the proof. Possibilities and surety both different scenarios. 97% doesn't just say there is a chance we came from that orangutangs. It also says there's a possibility there could be something else out there and we are just more similar to orangutangs as per our understanding now.

>and that is main problem with religion, its beliefs and interpretation because religion was invented to control sheep like you. 

Religion was formed as way to live one's life. People used it as tool to their desires. Just like computers are used for computation but hackers use it for their convenience. There are two parts of a coin. You still use the computer knowing that there is some one else who is using the same technology for his own gain.

>Are you going to enforce those law or your hindu friends going to eforce by killing innocent Muslims?

Society enforces them dude like seriously I just gave you example of different religious practices that are banned as per law. Law treats murder as murder no matter who is killed.Enforcing law is level's the field for each and every person of the society now maybe it be Hindu killing a Muslim( innocent or not) or visa versa. Even if your friends kill for money they are going be murders under law not atheist. That's the importance of enforcing part in law. Even if people fear it , people will live with peace of mind.

>Then why are you not differentiating people on their caste and gender?

Because my religious books never discriminated anyone on the basis of caste or gender. The religion worships form of woman. It even worships the mensuration cycles of a woman. It tells us women need to be protected by men in all phases of life first by father, then by husband and later the children. It does not ever say any gender is weak. It just has some guidelines for having a peaceful and balanced life. Just because you hear these things in news with the word religion attached to it doesn't religion says that. It's what people have interpreted as. Humans do these things out of their feelings , not religion.

>Do you think Brahmins are superior to other castes as your ancestors belived?

Brahman was titled given to scholars just like modern world gives Dr. Everyone was allowed to obtain knowledge and there are many auch people who were born in different caste but after studying and attaining knowledge were regarded as bhraman. This is why you need present all the teachings of books and history so you can understand what it was meant to be and what happened when someone came along and changed it's meaning in certain way. Do you not respect you teachers or the experts of their fields? Are they not superior in terms to you right now? The Brahmin you have in your mind are the ones on the basis of caste and not knowledge. I respect the later as they did in past but now modern Brahmin do not justify the title so I choose not to think of them as in superior in any way.

>So if I write a book saying kill all muslims and your loved ones, that book is good, its not at fault when it spread such a hateful idealogy like your religion.?

You wrote it out of your freedom of expression. Should you? No. If you do, what will happen to you? You'll be punished. What'll happen to your book? Discarded? No. It'll be taught to future generation in context of how it is wrong and what are the consequences to avoid anyone with such mindset to come up again in the history. That's why we are taught about people like Hitler and other such historical figures. The fact that you know about the history of Hitler, Nazi's and their ideology is because you were allowed to study about them. You were also taught how it was wrong and even though some good like satellites came out of it, what took place is nothing to be proud of for entire human civilisation as we know it. If the world had gotten rid of all the documents and papers that are related to Nazi, today you wouldn't know what happens when a dictator rises and how it's not something to be happy about as Germans might have been when Hitler rose. You'd be still using satellites but do not have any idea about the reality of that invention because it was all discarded by the world. The past serves us as reminder and guide. We learn from it move forward in an acceptable course into future as per our choice. I'm not saying teach just religion but also teach everything it has brought about in this world right from the good aspects to bad aspects so that there is understanding of both actions and consequences.",1,4,1608352437.0,theoppositeme,False,negative,neutral,neutral,neutral
