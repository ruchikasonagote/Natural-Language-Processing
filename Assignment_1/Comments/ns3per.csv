h0l2ni6,"I have a slightly different take on this. 

OP mentioned his performance in Mathematics was poor. He was attracted to sketching and devoted himself to perfecting it. I wonder why he didn't do the same with Mathematics or related subjects? He was able to sample different subjects(through formal schooling) and identify that(sketching) which gave him the most satisfaction and was able to accomplish a high degree of skill with dedicated practice. Perhaps his intrinsic abilities were already wired to be a creative person, and he discovered what he was naturally good at. 
He could be taught mathematics by the finest Math professors and spend hours solving problems, but that wouldn't be a spectacular ability like another individual who is naturally gifted with numbers and logical ability. Unless he has the rare ability to finely balance both with active hemispheres. 

Art is what he is naturally good at. He was able to make quick improvements with 100s of hours invested that were intrinsically driven.
Other subjects could be learnt easily if he LIKED them, but they may not have the same stunning outputs like his art. They don't compete with his primary talent. 

I might be making a lot of assumptions here, and OP might be awesome at every single thing except Math. Rock on, my man!",26,4,1622824796.0,Zer0Treble,False,neutral,positive,positive,positive
