f2purzj,"I'm just glad the movie was uncut. Such violent scenes actually surprised me, and it added to the factor of not completely sympathising with Joker. 

The tobacco disclaimer wasn't distracting to me. Most of us are used to that shit.

But the interval kind of ruined the flow of the movie. I think I had watched Spiderman without intervals. Wish it there was none for this movie too.

Still a great movie. Loved it.",166,0,1570350767.0,redditoradi,1570350995.0,positive,positive,positive,positive

As for the smoking and drinking disclaimer, I love the hypocrisy of our governments.
