Most dark skinned actors are given side roles as villains/gangsters or comedy roles (Eg. Johnny Lever). Look up any of Salman Khan's action movies and you'll see most of the actors who play villain/gangster are naturally dark. So for primary roles they're going to always choose fair skinned actors, or make them fair skinned to get that item song hit. Moreover, they have just recently started hiring people like Rajkumar Rao and Nawazuddin Siddique who are naturally brown/dark for primary roles. There is Radhika Apte who gets good roles, and she is naturally brown, but I'm yet to see this happen among more actresses.

h0odg1t,"Thank you for pointing this out. It has bugged me from so many years. There are so many movies, not just this one and Bala.

1. There's a Telugu movie (don't know the name) where this dark-skinned girl likes the main guy (Shivaji, I think) and writes love letters to him. She feels that he won't accept her because, you know, black is black. She tells her fair-skinned friend to pretend to be her and the story goes on. Finally, the guy realises it's all about inner beauty because, you know, dark people only have personalities and cannot be beautiful. 

The point here is that there was so much grease on the lady playing the dark-skinned heroine that it was literally melting under the lights. 

2. Vivah (Hindi): This movie pisses the hell out of me. Orphaned Amrita Rao is the apple of her uncle's eye because (subconsciously) she is fair and therefore, beautiful. His own daughter is dark and not so favoured. The aunt, Seema Biswas, hates the neice because she is fair and lovely and her daughter is dark and eww! Lots of blah blah happens and there's a fire. Amrita Rao gets burned only neck down because, you know, fair has to protected.  She survives with her fairness and hymen intact and the aunt realises fair is indeed pure. 

Point is that the actress playing the dark-skinned sister was put in dark makeup instead of actually hiring a dark actress.

3. Airaa (Tamil): This movie has Nayanathara playing two roles (a city girl, village girl). I have not seen the movie but I have seen many scenes. It looks like they made the village character darker because, you know, colonial mindset. And the dark-skinned one is supposed to have a lot of bad luck. It sort of says that she's dark so she has bad luck. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I haven't watched this movie. But I'm saying this from what little I've seen.

The same dark-peeling-off makeup is applied to make her look dark. 


As someone who is dark-skinned myself, I get so angry seeing these overly darkened heroines who cannot embody what it feels like to truly live a life where people discriminate and insult you based on your skin colour. 

I do have a lot of acquaintances who are really dark themselves but when wanting a girlfriend/boyfriend they specify ""that person should be fair"". Some of them use the term ""black"" (as in black colour) to refer to dark-skinned people. Another co-worker doesn't like Kajol (who I think is very talented) because of the fact that she is dark (at least, she was initially. Now I just sigh in frustration looking at her). Another NE co-worker, on my first day of work, said (to another co-worker) loudly in front of me, ""I don't want to become dark and ugly"". 

This set of people basically sums up a majority of the country. Those who think dark skin is ugly and repulsive. And that's why filmmakers choose fair heroines over actual dark ones. Because people would rather see themselves as fair in dark makeup than dark and beautiful.

And lastly, Deepika Padukone, Priyanka Chopra, Bipasha Basu are not ""dusky"" or ""dark"". I hate it when people use dusky for these people. If they are fair enough for Bollywood to cast them as lead actresses, then they are fair.

>Robert Downey Jr's character is Kirk Lazarus, a five-time Oscar winning Australian method actor who is cast as African-American Staff Sargent Lincoln Osiris. Kirk undergoes a controversial ""pigmentation alteration"" procedure to darken his skin and, being method, he's in the habit of never breaking character until after he's done DVD commentary. While this could have led to a negative response to Tropic Thunder (the real movie), given blackface is usually associated with mocking black people, that didn't happen in this instance. Robert Downey Jr. was even nominated for an Oscar for the role, and has continued to defend it since, and the lack of controversy is due to the movie's satirical approach.

>The film mocks everything ""wrong"" with Hollywood: product placement, drug use and addiction, problematic productions, megalomaniacal producers that are more interested in making money than telling stories, and the ludicrousness of Hollywood using serious subjects as money-making fodder. Downey Jr's blackface is no different, as it is shown as part of the same ridiculousness of Hollywood, nor does it go unaddressed in the story. Alongside Ben Stiller and Downey Jr. is Brandon T. Jackson in the role of Alpa Chino, a rapper attempting to break into acting. He doesn't let Kirk off the hook, and even claims that he's making the movie to offer some ""real representation.""

We can cry all we want, they have a fiduciary responsibility towards the investment made by producers and provide returns, which can only come from a star stud casting.

We as a society need to give fair chances to dark skin, appreciate their work, grow their following, watch their movies for them to be successful as fair skinned people.

It'll only come through breaking the stereotype at our personal level.

h0om4ur,"If the colour of someone's skin makes the whole movie wrong for you then YOU are what's wrong. Don't take it personally but movies do cut corners and don't always have the money to fulfil the script to it's entirety.  So compromises have to be made and you have to accept them or don't watch the movie.

If my favourite actor/actress was to take a role in a new movie and they were a perfect fit for that role, it would make the film more enjoyable for me because my favourite actor/actress is in it. But then why would they need to don make up or fake accents even ? 

For example, why did English speaking American, Canadian, Indian and British actors/actresses have to speak in German accents in war films when the uniform would have been enough information to tell you they are playing the role of a German soldier? Why the accent as well ? German soldiers did not speak to each other in English with a 'German accent'.  

I appreciate a movie has to represent certain criteria, but you have to accept a partial compromise as nothing can be recreated exactly because of artistic licence and well, people don't always look exactly like the figure they are playing. Not only that, things will always be dramatised or exaggerated otherwise we would never watch them in the first place. And its the STORY that is being portrayed to you. But you will hear people say the film is nothing like the book. Well that's because a book is written differently than a film and a film is always 'BASED' on a book or true story, like I said earlier, it's creative licence again as well as budget.

But movies have descriptions and tell you who is playing what character so you are not confused as to who is who and what the plot is and they also have reviews. Does nobody read this information anymore?

It appears the nations have been dumbed down and expectations have been fixed to a notion that nothing can change. We have allowed these divisions to be put in place by our rulers. If you don't want colour to be an issue, then we need to pursue a path in our society that does not need to know your colour when filling in a form unless there is a specific medical need for it. Why do we need to know what colour someone is? expectation that's why. It's been set and it's all that is to be expected. Break this cycle, and the problem will go away.

Rajya Sabha member and MDMK leader Vaiko wrote a letter to the Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar on May 19 to stop the broadcast of the show. He alleged it shows Tamilians in a negative light. As per Vaiko, the show depicted “Tamilians as terrorists and ISI Agents and having link with Pakistan.” An excerpt of his letter read, “These descriptions have hurt the sentiments of Tamil people and Tamil culture and offensive against the Tamil community. The people of Tamil Nadu are raising serious objections over such act and are protesting against the Serial.”  
  
**Who else is objecting?**

  
Naam Tamilar Katchi leader Seeman had also demanded a ban on The Family Man 2 for “intentionally portraying the LTTE as terrorists and Tamils as vicious people”. He tweeted his concerns and also alleged that its story being set in Chennai was no coincidence.  
  
Later, the Tamil Nadu government objected to the series, and claimed the Raj and DK show ‘depicts the Eelam Tamils in a highly objectionable manner’. In a letter to I&B minister Prakash Javadekar, the Tamil Nadu Minister T Mano Thangaraj stated, “I would like to bring to your notice about the condemnable, inappropriate and malicious contents of The Family Man 2 serial in Hindi, which depicts the Eelam Tamils in a highly objectionable manner. The trailer of the above said serial which was released in the social media network is aimed at discrediting and distorting the historical struggle of Eelam Tamils in Sri Lanka.”

Do you not think that the fact that fairer skinned people are consistently given roles of dark skinned characters, is not a reflection of how dark skinned actors don't even get a chance in this industry? 

You seem to think that this is an attack on hritik or Samantha or whatever. No. It's an attack on producers. Because media like movies and tv shows and music and such contribute to the culture of a country. By doing something like this, you are as a producer directly  contributing to the propagation of these ideas.

Do you agree or not that India has a problem with skin colour? 

If you agree, then I have a second question. (If you disagree then well maybe you've not lived in India.)

Do you not think that cinema actors are used as benchmarks for beauty and such, and by consistently gatekeeping darker skinned people from the cinema industry, these ideas keep getting reinforced?

Like, you can literally count out dark skinned actors in this country. Even a guy like Rajnikanth does not show his real skin colour in his movies. 


Honestly I've watched hindi, bengali, gujarati, marathi, tamil and malayalam content, and this exists across the board. This shit happens in every industry. It's a bit less so in Bengali cinema. In tamil and malayalam, the male actors will be dark but the actresses will never be. The actresses are actually frequently north indians/gujjus. Why? 

Bengali cinema is diverse but I guess that has to do with the fact that there's many people from northeast, from UP/Bihar, and bongs themselves. Creates a nice mix. 


Bollywood's nepotism circle is all fair skinned north indians. Dark skinned actors are extras, villains, or mazdoors. Even the good ones.

Manoj Bajpayee's entire career was made off being a villain. No mainstream roles for this guy either. Zubeidaa was an exception there tho but idk if anyone even watched that movie lol.

Radhika Apte will be the first to tell you there's a colour problem. 'woke' Netflix went out of their way for her. And even now she's not in the mainstream, she acts more in arthouse films or films produced by OTT.

If you watch south cinema you'd know dhanush is a dogshit example to give. I'll let you figure out why, it's pretty obvious. 

Fun fact, even rajni had to make his skin fairer in most movies. He's much much blacker.

As for your last para. Just use her then na why paint her, it's so unnecessary. Just act, what utility does the paint serve. Like, at what point has anybody said 'give it to an undeserving person', like what false equivalence is this? 


Just ask yourself. Why? If the matter was simply about being a good actor, then you can sell the role without the paint.

We have both experienced the same upbringing and culture, unlike in the U.S where white people and black people actually have cultural differences.

What I am saying is that using the term ""Brown face"" implies that using makeup to achieve a darker skin tone is done in the same negative sense as it is done in western countries. The two are not similar.

I think you aren't watching movies at all, Nawaz doesn't get mainstream roles? Wasseypur? Raman Raghav? Freaky Ali? Manjhi? Also what elitism bullshit this is? Mazdoor or a cop? Leading role is leading role no matter what it is, I think your idea of a leading role is romancing with a heroine in foreign locations.

Again with Manoj bajpaayee I don't think you know what leading role means to you, negative or positive a lead is a lead. Satya was an amazing movie, but if you narrow definition is to be taken, he has done career defining positive roles as well, heard of shool?

Watch rajnis earlier movies he has his natural skin tone, everyone puts on some make up in movie industry

You're enforcing issues we don't have. By your definition all the fair skin actors were the only ones being given chances. If that was true we would have Ajay devgn, Akshay Kumar, Om Puri, Sadashirao leading in 80s and 90s.

The paint was required for authenticity, a mentally sick guerilla fighter won't exactly have amazing visual features. Same reason Hrithik had it in super 30, make up done either way for authenticity isn't racism. 

Even after stating it twice you're still asking me if India has a problem or not? I'm not saying it doesn't, I'm saying not everything is rooted in it.

I think your definition of mainstream is broken, by your definition we wouldn't have konkona, kajol, Shilpa, Rakhi count as mainstream. Also what would you call Deepika and Priyanka? Please don't say they have now become fairer, makeup and better skin routine is not a criminal offence and also isn't rooted in racism. Again if you mean doing commercial dogshit like nargis fakhri and Disha, I'm glad Nandita das isn't a mainstream actor. And if only having white skin was enough tamannah would rule Bollywood.

>Actor ko jo role mila usme daalo

I would agree with that if it worked across the board. Ask yourself seriously, are the opportunities equal for people of all types of looks? And hritik is a good actor? Okay. Chodo wo baat. 

If you think opportunities are equal by the way, you're wrong. Don't forget ki ye nepotists ka industry hai. Lund se they are getting it for their acting chops. 

One of my closest and oldest friends is a guy who works in cinematography, and while he's not rich or anything, he benefited a lot from the son of a major bollywood director who he happened to befriend. So despite no real connects or anything, he managed to actually find good work, and got an admission into whistling woods despite being unable to afford it earlier. This guy doesn't look like the people at whistling woods. Of course when I say the previous sentence, I'm referring to the actors. If you're training to be someone not in front of the camera nobody cares. Actors, right from the very starting point have to look a certain way. 


And it particularly boils my blood when people give example of Nawaz, Radhika Apte, Irrfan and Manoj Bajpayee. Matlab they're proving my point for me. These fuckers suffered for decades as extras and garbage tier roles. It took them OTT content and 'woke' directors like Anurag Kashyap, Vishal Bhardwaj, Prakash Jha and for people to take them seriously. When did Karan Johar give him a chance? Or Aditya Chopra? Or any lauda lasan generic bollywood chodu. The only people to give these people chances were outsiders themselves. These people had to do arthouse roles to earn chillar money. 


Matlab on what basis do people say that deserving dark skinned actors would get the role of they had the talent?

If acting talent mattered then Nandita Das would be in every big movie. If acting talent mattered, then these all these people should've gotten chances. But they didn't. Fair skinned people DO get it easier and you know it. Nai toh a guy like Nawaz wouldn't need to be an extra for 20-30 years. And please watch some 90s movies where he's an extra. Tell me he doesn't have the talent. Do minute ke scene mei rongte khade honge. Lekin kab mila usse finally recognition? After gangs of wasseypur.

This is what OP said. How is this exactly wrong? Why does it imply anything wrong? It doesn't take an idiot to recognise that a majority of South Indians, nay, Indians have more melanin. Fair skinned people are a minority. How does portraying a person as dark skinned suddenly imply everyone is dark skinned? It just means a majority may be dark skinned. Is somehow being dark skinned wrong? Because that seems like the implication in OPs statement. 

Instead we should look at the character and it's motivations which doesn't seem to have anything to do with the fact that they are dark skinned. 

Being dark skinned isn't problematic and if you think it's problematic, you are the one being problematic.

OP also said this
""I know, but they're stereotype is more of a negative connotation""

Can you explain what negative connotation as a progressive person do you hold to being dark skinned? If you are going to say ""but people think dark skinned people are not beautiful"", then why are you listening to them? They are racist fucks, their opinions shouldn't hold value. By saying it holds a negative connotation to them, so we shouldn't portray south Indians as dark you are legitimising the arguments of the racists. Fuck em.

Yes but you will get shitty lines and taunts from aunties and family members. And you know it happens. 

Cinema is a part of culture. Culture is what influences society. When cinema propagates certain ideas they enter the cultural zeitgeist. That's why it is an issue. Because these movies directly lead to defining what beauty ideals are, and those beauty ideals in turn lead to those aunties saying shitty things like 'itni sawli hai, shaadi mushkil se hogi', or god knows what else. I've seen it in my family, I've seen it in the families of my friends and cousins, I've seen it in north India, in South India, in Maharashtra, in Gujarat. It's everywhere.

h0rwhwy,"> It will get stifling to watch everything you say and do.

Is this what your fear is? Idk what it's like in India, but I can tell you what it's like in the US to some extent and I think it's safe to say that if you are the wrong race / skin color in the US, then you already have to ""watch everything you say and do."" More so if you are the wrong gender too (for example, a black woman). 

For my own part, I'm a white man living in the US, which is basically the top privileged group. The only part I'm missing is I'm not at all wealthy. Idk what group you fit in, in India, but for someone like me in my country, I almost never have to watch anything I say and do, unless it's obviously law-breaking in a big way. And even then, the police response to white men who do things like mass shootings is sometimes way more lenient than the response to a black man not exactly complying with every order from a cop who is giving them instructions they can't possibly follow.

When you put this kind of thing in context and start being more conscious of it, you can start to see how dismantling the systems that enforce your own privilege, or at least getting out of the way of marginalized groups who are trying to do that, is key for ""enlightened action"" (as you put it).

The ""extreme"" of those of us in a privileged group ending up ""stifling everything we say and do"" largely seems to be a fear driven by an understanding of what has been and continues to be done to others, and is not based in reality.

If your government is enforcing these issues with their policies, I'm not at all saying a government like that should step in and ""censor the arts."" But if an actor here and there can be shamed into rethinking what they choose to do (if they have some freedom to pick roles) then maybe that's a good thing and maybe they will think a little harder about their status.

I’d like to add abit of an anecdote, I assume when you say black you refer to being African American? In my party friend group we often go out partying with a community that came over to Australia from Zimbabwe and there is a very obvious distinction between our two cultures (SEA and Zimbabwe). From the way we greet each other, to the way we eat or celebrate, or even overall speaking volume. A lot of my female friends have complained that when they get hit on they feel incredibly objectified, which I feel it’s because the Zimbabwean dudes tend to be very assertive and the regular SEA girls aren’t used to it.

Indian Americans are mostly Democrats in the U.S according to quantitative analyses but a large number of them voted for Republican Donald Trump in this election, anecdotal evidence suggests. And one of the main reasons that many cite for doing so is Huma Abedin, former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s close aide, who happens to be a Muslim.

To my little knowledge, don’t the Okinawa people hate having the Americans on their soil? Specifically the military bases, because of their rampant raping and drunken driving accidents that have led to a few deaths. Or brawls and stuff. Somewhat related but the Japanese are also traditionally not huge fans of Okinawa and other islands because they think of them as inferior (WW2). 

Also I’d like to add that we are more exposed to western media and their ways and mannerisms so it is less of a culture shock to dating a western man (by extension, a white man, because they dominate media) than say, an African man or a middle eastern person or even a Western European fellow. There’s less of a “barrier to entry”.
