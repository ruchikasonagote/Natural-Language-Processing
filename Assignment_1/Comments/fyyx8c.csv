fn2q6ft,"This inequality will happen when we have a free market economy, but no social democracy. Like in the USA, and now India, which emulates them. 

Unless a country offers free world class education and healthcare, this gap will only increase. Most European countries that offer these don’t have such a yawning gap between the rich and poor. Tax money is used to give free education and healthcare of a very high degree of quality. 

When free quality education is lacking, opportunities to the poor are denied because the rich will send their children to the good schools, and will obviously have a head start over their poor counterparts for quality jobs. And the rich-poor gap will only increase. But if the poor were to receive the same (and free) quality education, they will be able to compete on a equal footing, and this gap will slowly reduce. 

Healthcare is a major financial burden when people get seriously ill. The rich have access to the best healthcare, and they can afford it. The not-so-well off will see a major chunk of their savings shaved off if they fall seriously ill. Only a free quality healthcare system will allow them to not worry about this expense head. But as things stand today, here too we are copying the USA system of healthcare (one of the worst in the western world), where the insurance companies make all the money, and yet this is denied to the poor. 

Our tax money needs to go into these two heads if the country’s rich-poor divide is to reduce. Else the situation will get progressively worse, something that we are currently witnessing. 

But our political class does not have such a vision. So it’s all a pipe dream.",355,0,1586598834.0,khushraho,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

The rest 50% should not be tax exempted.

Solution would be track every transaction so that black money and bribery can be removed. That way, wealth can be accurately measured.

My solution contains the following parts:

1. No Income tax, not on salaried class, not on businesspersons, not on farmers etc.
2. No Corporate tax, as Corporations/Businesses don't pay tax, people pay tax. The factory doesn't pay tax, the buildings don't pay tax. Either Business Owners (Shareholders etc.) pay tax, or Employees pay tax or Customers pay tax.
3. Only Consumption based tax (like GST), only people who consume goods & services should pay tax. They pay taxes in the proportion they consume the said goods & services.
4. People have freedom to do whatever they like, as long as they don't interfere with others' freedom to do the same. This includes starting any business, hiring or firing any number of employees etc, buying or selling any goods or services for which there is demand.
5. Government expenditure should be less than or equal to it's income.
6. Government should provide infrastructure where contracts can be honored and fully enforced.
7. Government should provide security from Internal and External Threats. Everything else private citizens can manage.",0,0,1586619579.0,Nomad1900,False,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

fn41hde,"Ok here are some calculations, and my deductions based on them.

India's land area is 3287263 km2. Population was 133 crore in 2016.

60% of land is 1972357.8 km2.

1% of population is 1.3 crore or 13000000.

Dividing 1972357.8 by 13000000 we get 0.151

So this 1%, on average, owns 0.151 km2, or 151 metre square of land, or a plot of 15x10 metres. 

Which means almost any land owning farmer is in the 1%.

Further, the source article says 60% of Indian wealth (90 trillion rupees) goes to 1% of our population.


So 90 trillion (9 followed by 12 zeros) divided by 13000000 is Rs. 692307.7. 

This means that to be a part of India's richest 1%, you need to have a total wealth of 692308 INR.

This is half correct, but not in the way you might think.

There are a number of issues with this map of India.

1) Wealth is not zero sum, it is created. The 1% aren’t taking wealth away from the poor, rather the real gross output is [increasing at historic levels](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/historys-hockey-stick-worldwide-historical-gross-domestic-product-percapita-1990), and the rich are enjoying the fruits of that wealth creation disproportionately more than the poor — largely because the wealth creation can largely be attributed to the higher level decision makers (read: executives). Land, however, is zero sum. It is fixed. So this map looks scary, because if wealth was zero sum and the distribution looked like that, things would be pretty dystopian.

A better analogy would be to imagine that India, as a nation is growing in size, and the 1% own a piece of land the size of the Pacific Ocean, and the 50% own land the size of all of India. In that framing, the poor aren’t necessarily worse off, the rich are just much much better off at a more rapid rate. It is debatable whether this is acceptable, but that’s the level of nuance that’s missing from OP’s map. And when you reduce the denominator by taking all of the insane growth that the world has experienced and normalize it down to the size of the landmass of India, the numerator ends up looking much smaller than it actually is.

2) It is debatable how important it is to look at unrealized wealth. The vast VAST majority of wealth that has been created in the last 100 years is illiquid/unrealized. Unrealized wealth is just a number on a ledger. To actually do anything with the wealth, you have to realize those gains. Ambani’s crores mostly just represents the right to receive a share of Reliance’s profits in the future. If Reliance’s gross production goes up, he gains crores in “wealth.” But to actually have any impact on the external world with that wealth, he has to either receive dividends (which, in the USA is taxed as income), or realize the gain by selling his stock (which are also taxed). Even if he takes a loan with Reliance stock as collateral, at some point he has to realize some gain somewhere to have cash to pay back the loan. If he decides to liquidate all of his stock, the underlying stock value will likely crater, destroying a lot of its value anyway. It’s not all just sitting in a checking account, it’s tied up in productive assets.

3) It is debatable how important wealth inequality is, relative to absolute poverty. Imagine you’re in a bar, where everyone has roughly equal wealth. Then imagine that Jeff Bezos walks into the bar. The wealth distribution in the bar would immediately look like the above map, but nobody in the bar would actually be materially worse off. What really matters is the absolute wealth, and absolute standard of living, especially that of the poorest. Post-liberalization, India [has halved its poverty rate](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/india-halved-its-poverty-rate-since-1990s-world-bank/articleshow/71608220.cms?from=mdr), and the standard of living across the board has improved to the extent that India is now considered a middle income country. Note that we actually did try “social democracy” (Nehruvian socialism), and India was pretty impoverished, the standard of living throughout India was poor compared to the rest of the world.

So tl;dr - underlying total wealth has grown, and the distribution of who has received that new wealth has been unequal. Scaling that back down to a fixed non-zero sum representation of a nation’s land is extraordinarily misleading. The fact that total wealth has grown to the degree that it has can be directly attributable to “free market economies”.",60,1,1586622157.0,bhupy,1586622975.0,negative,negative,neutral,negative

Teachers of every kind of schools still somehow manages to skip the chapters of Sexual reproduction and no one else teaches us about it. We use internet to know more about it and some kids/teens founds the dark side of it in the process. 
One of our main problem is over population and that is because of such poor education system. Skipping the chapter of sexual reproduction consequences in the lack of use of condoms and such.

Why do people on reddit love this canard? The percentage you're referring to are the ones that pay INCOME TAX. Everyone in India pays taxes, of which income tax is only a small part. Each time a farmer buys seeds, he's paying tax. Each time a labourer pays for a cup of tea, she's paying tax. Each time a maid receives her pay in cash, she buys food, or clothes, and each time, she pays tax. 

Of the government's total income, only 26.3% comes from income tax. So this bizarre claim that ""One, this way the top 10% support the government"" is just a thing that the middle class tells itself so that it may adopt a position of supposed virtuousness. Our government is not funded on the benevolence of the middle class. It is funded on the backs of the poorest, and in a manner that perpetrates historic and social inequalities that keep them at the bottom of the ladder.

Just because wealth is not a zero sum game, it can not justify disproportionate distribution.

Size of the pie is increasing, but how much of the increased pie is shared between stakeholders in what distribution is the underlying issue here. 
For example Jeff Bezos, the argument is that he gets to withhold most of the value created by Amazon for himself without sharing proportionate amount of it to the other value adders and capitalism allows it. 

Say, their delivery staff(I'm illustrating Indian context of Amazon). The reason for it is each of the delivery staff is easily replaceable, compromising their bargaining position for a good pay. This replaceability factor or commoditization of this role is due to socio-political factors given the state of evolution of India as an independent state or economy.

>Tax money is already going into these places.

So providing completely free quality education and healthcare for everyone will provide so much more government jobs. As a result, government will receive more taxes.

Most of those teachers are not well educated themselves because of our poor quality education.

Do you know the tuition fee of Mbbs or MS/MD/DNB in India?
There are nearly no Government seats.
Most of them are taken by rich people through management quota.
Mbbs costs you on average 13 lakhs per year in some average college.
So in total it costs you 65 lakhs.

Your comparison with Micheal Phelps is not meaningful. If you are suggesting that his success in the world of swimming is somehow a parallel to someones success in an unchecked capitalist system, you need to consider a few things. 

1. People do complain about the discrimination of elite sport. Swimming requires access to specialist facilities to train. And the luxury of time to do so. It is untrue to say 'everyone had the same opportunity to compete for those gold medals hes won.' They didn't. Many countries recognise this and spend tax money to subsidise the development of sports training facilities in poorer communities, and sponsor promising young athletes who cant afford to fully commit to training financially.  In a sense, the redistribution of phelps financial success you talk of is already happening, through the taxes he pays on his earnings, being spent (in part) to broaden opportunities for others to follow in his footsteps.

In fact Phelps feels even more strongly about this than to just pay his taxes. 

'Phelps established the Michael Phelps Foundation with the $1MM bonus he received for winning eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games.' 

'They have established the Level Field Fund-Swimming, a grant giving program that provides funding to uniquely talented swimmers in need of financial assistance.'

So yeah. Phelps has already redistributed the financial aspect of many of the gold medals he recieved. 

2. Societies work on buy in. We agree to social contracts because we see value in them, that outweighs the restrictions they place upon us. If everyone keeps getting richer, despite the inbalanced distribution, you probably will keep getting buy in. The moment it stagnates or goes south for a large proportion of society the structures the rich rely upon to make their money and keep them in the manner they are accustomed to become very shakey.

The disagreement on this line between Sen and Bhagwati is famously known as the ""Sen-Bhagwati debate"". Simply said, Bhagwati puts growth before welfare, whereas Sen puts welfare before growth. 

I'm not an economist or any expert, but my heart goes with Sen here.  I don't trust that the trickle down effect will be able to catch up with the rising inequality. But even if it does, I find it unacceptable to tell the poor who are struggling to even survive that  ""hold on while we collect some more wealth, then we'll give some to you.""

fn4aq5y,">	You have scratched the surface of the problem without addressing the core ideological challenges here.

Yes, and this is nuance that is entirely missing from this overly simplistic map of India.

>	Size of the pie is increasing, but how much of the increased pie is shared between stakeholders in what distribution is the underlying issue here. For example Jeff Bezos, the argument is that he gets to withhold most of the value created by Amazon for himself without sharing proportionate amount of it to the other value adders and capitalism allows it.

Most early Amazon employees (workers) also are also now worth hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars because they all had a part to play in the creation of that value. It is more challenging, requires more risk, and a higher opportunity cost to create an Amazon from scratch, than it does to maintain such an institution. The rewards are proportionate.

>	Say, their delivery staff(I'm illustrating Indian context of Amazon). The reason for it is each of the delivery staff is easily replaceable, compromising their bargaining position for a good pay. This replaceability factor or commoditization of this role is due to socio-political factors given the state of evolution of India as an independent state or economy. That is in general how capitalism works. An individual is rewarded based on market factors but not by absolute value added by the person. Market factors are down to socio-economic issues determined by history as well.

The role of markets is to minimize the amount of input necessary to produce goods/services, while maximizing the output of those goods/services. In practice, this means driving down the price of goods/services to the minimum possible price, while making them as abundant as possible, and as high quality as possible. This is good for consumers, because they can purchase those goods/services cheaply. This is why bread, milk, eggs, washing machines, clothes, TVs etc have gotten cheaper over time, relative to inflation.

Another good/service that consumers purchase is labor, mostly indirectly. The market is also very good at driving down the price of labor, and this is why wages don't outpace inflation, in the same way that the price of bread doesn't outpace inflation. Again, this is excellent for consumers, because the labor is an input in the production of goods/services, and the former’s cost is a part of the latter cost that consumers ultimately pay. The market value of some labor is below the threshold for ""livable wage"". This is an inevitability of the fact that the individual unit of some labor is, well, not all that valuable. This is where welfare comes in, because we as a society rightly demand a minimum standard of living for everyone.

>	We live in an unfair world where capitalists are disproportionately rewarded more than the common man.

While markets are the most efficient way to produce goods & services to people, welfare is important to make sure that the weakest among us aren’t left behind. And, of course the folks with extraordinary skills are rewarded more, the creation of the wealth is most attributable to their higher leverage knowledge work. This is no different from IAS officers getting rewarded more than administrative clerks, or doctors getting rewarded more than railway station coolies — despite, in both cases, the latter group “working harder”.",1,3,1586637520.0,bhupy,1586638823.0,neutral,negative,negative,negative

After the death of Mao Zedong, the Communist Party leadership turned to market-oriented reforms to salvage the failing economy. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, China de-collectivized agriculture, opened up of the country to foreign investment, and allowed entrepreneurs to start businesses. In the late 1980s and 1990s, China underwent further privatization and contracting out of much state-owned industry and the lifting of price controls, protectionist policies, and regulations, although state monopolies in sectors such as banking and petroleum remained.

fn5azon,"“Trickle down” is not a real thing. It’s a pejorative meant to attack supply-side economics. It’s like calling Keynesianism “money printer go brrr economics”. It’s also a really inaccurate attack of supply-side economics.

The basic account of ""trickle-down economics"" goes something like this. When you give a tax cut to a rich guy, he uses the money to buy party supplies for a celebratory yacht party. The guy who owns the yacht party supply store sees an influx of cash from rich guys spending their trickle down tax cuts on yacht party supplies and orders a pizza to celebrate, and gives the pizza guy a big fat trickle-down tip. As you can see, the tax cut started out at the rich guy, but before long even the lowly pizza delivery guy is getting a piece of that sweet trickle-down cheddar.
Notice an interesting thing about this account: it is fundamentally a demand-side story. 

In this story, the trickling down happens as a result of people spending extra money on goods and services. It is not about creating supply. So it's absolutely silly to call this an account of supply-side economics. This isn't even close to the supply-side story. And people point out that it's a flawed story, because poorer people probably have a higher marginal propensity to consume than rich people, so you'd be better off giving the tax cut or equivalent transfer payments to poor people if you want to stimulate economic activity. Well, yeah, no shit, that's because this is a complete straw-man and no economist actually believes that this story is true.

What some economists do believe is that the path to prosperity is via the supply curve and not the demand curve. Making things cheaper to make and cheaper to buy makes people better off faster than just giving them money to buy things at existing levels of production. And the way to do that is investment—investment meaning, in the economics sense, spending on things like factories and equipment. There is a huge body of theory and evidence to support this idea—higher levels of investment do lead to faster growth. So supply siders believe that things like taxes on capital gains are harmful to the economy on the margin because they reduce spending on investment, and may even encourage spending on consumption, which is a bad outcome to the supply-sider. They also believe in reducing barriers on production—things like government regulation and income taxes. This basically describes liberalization of economies, which has resulted in the global prosperity that we see today.

Every single major economy, from US, Canada, all the way to UK, Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Singapore — operates on free market economies addressing the supply curve, with generous Keynesian welfare.

1. Even if Ambani wanted to visit govt hospital, they would neither deny him, nor charge him. So, it's free.
2. Same, even if rich wanted to go there, they will teach for free.

Now, let's talk about the quality of both of them. Money goes to govt hospitals, corrupt management and head surgeons just distribute the money among themselves. 

Same thing with govt schools. Those people even take mid day money and provide substandard food. I agree budget is way less than it should be, but problem is not only with the govt(which changes every 5 years), but also with the officials working down the line, who don't change with the govt. There's no transparency among them. Modi actually tried to bring transparency during his first couple of years, before going mad and ruining country.

Blame the govt all you want, but culprits also live among us. 

3. About not many people paying taxes because they are in private? Where did you get that from?
Private companies deduct TDS, same as govt companies, and are more rigorous than anyone else, to make sure relevant taxes are paid. And also, I would love to see from where did you pull up that 97% number. 
Also, corporate taxes constitute the highest percentage in all the taxes collected (https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/finance/budget-2019-for-every-rupee-in-govt-kitty-68-paise-come-from-taxes/articleshow/70090419.cms)
Also, how did you deduce that free education, healthcare means much more govt jobs? I would love to know your thoughts on this.

4. Again, no, not really. Most of the teachers are uneducated because of corruption. I am from a small town in Bihar, and I have seen the ground reality. To become teacher in govt schools, you need to pay bribes. Whoever pays more bribes, becomes teacher. No check for educational requirements or anything. When Bihar Govt wanted to enforce ctet exam on them, those teachers started bandh and mass protests, and ultimately govt had to give in because of public pressure. How, in the right mind, can you blame only govt for this? The people who took bribes, reside among us, in our apartments.
I am not surprised seeing such teachers can't even write A-Z. Also, I have a memory of govt school that was behind my house, and the headmistress used to sit in class and weave sweaters during winters.

5. Since I did engineering, I have actually no idea about costs, but I am sure in govt hospitals, there must be no fees for sc, st, ews and less fees for everyone in general. I also feel there are less good quality govt medical colleges in India. But still, why would you join govt hospitals then, if you don't want to provide your services there, just go and open your private clinics, and let someone who is willing to work in govt hospital join it.

6. I am from general category, from a poor family (yes, not all general categories are uber rich), from a small town in Bihar. I completed my higher education from my town itself, since my parents didn't have enough money to send me to kota/delhi/patna etc. I studied hard, for 12-14 hrs daily, topped class 12th exam, got admitted in one of the top enginnering college of india, and now, I am earning more than what many people can only dream of. So, no, I am in no way a failure. You know, what was my motivation for all these years? To get my family out of poverty, since I knew being a general category, no one else is there for us. 

7. In my time, there was no EWS. But I feel EWS is the way to go forward. Also, no I don't hate reservation. They are necessary for a country like India, which has a wide gap already. But I don't like it's current structure. You use reservation to get in college, fair enough. Now you graduate, like everyone else. Now, why do you need lower cutoff in job exams? Wasn't there a level playing field in college? Ok, nevermind, you got job with less percentage. Now, at the time of promotion, you need reservations again? Why? Wasn't 2 rounds of reservation enough? On top of that, your kids will also get reservation at all stages. I don't find it intuitive, and I feel this system doesn't award merit, because you know you can keep using reservation to go up, and you don't actually need to level yourself up. Now again, there are exceptions, but I have observed this general trend, where people from reserved categories don't really want to hustle hard, because they can get away with less efforts. I believe that you should only be able to use reservation once/twice, and then you should be treated same as others. In this way, it will also help people who need the reservation to uplift themselves.

8. Blaming everything doesn't improve anything. Start with yourself. Stop giving bribes when you get caught by traffic police. Call out for corruption in your neighborhood. Many of us are too small, for our voices to be heard by top brass. But we can make a little impact on ground level. And change does start from ground level.

These points are the problems of capitalism. They look at labor as only a resource and no more. For everything else, there is welfare through 'taxes' of valuable citizens of the country. 

1) They are able to get away with below minimum wages of labor which should not be allowed from purely humanitarian stand point. If there is human labor needed somewhere (especially non-skilled), having decent living wage should be part of the cost accounting. We get everything at cheaper price not just because of cheap labor but due to other technical & process advancements which should be the way to go. Even in USA which is the glowing success of capitalism, human dignity losses are exported to countries like philippines and combodia where little children are stitching Nike shoes at sub minimum wages in satanic working conditions. Indian IT workers provide services where US labor laws forbid certain 'cost cuts'. Capitalism finds a way to export losses to the more unfortunate. 

2) We can not have a situation where Knowledge work has higher leverage but the knowledge is only accessible to elite of the society. More chances that the gap is only going to widen, which thankfully things like internet and communication technology is rapidly changing. Nonetheless, that economic structure is partial to people with more money. 

3) Apart from knowledge, availability of capital to invest is the biggest determiner of who wins in a capitalist system. And we know the distribution wealth in society is due to historic and social factors again . A race with a different starting line for everybody. 

4) Even more generalizing, capitalism promotes cut throat competition in every sense that it one against another very similar to nomadic and cave men times. Only now we live in an economic jungle. Progress we made as social beings to be able to live in collective harmony is defeated. Rich people have more chance to make money so would keep accumulating more wealth promoting abusive consumerism, which in a way is the source of environmental and social issues. If entire world wanted to live like Americans, all resources of the world would be over within 2 generations before some apocalypse kind of shit hits mankind.

Giving huge tax cuts, cheap labour and land to Capitalists is investment, which increases profits and wealth in the hands of a few, while making majority wage slaves, increasing inequality.

First of all, the Government buys land to give for Capitalists for throwaway prices by snatching land from lakhs of people. (Sometimes by use of force and without compensation, like in Central India against Adivasis, there are reports of your so called ""Wealth Creators"" arming Death Squads to kill protesting adivasis). All these people lose the means of production and then have to migrate to Urban areas and have to sell their labour power for the Capitalists forming a pool of cheap labour.

Secondly, these ""Wealth creators"" demand Tax cuts and find myriad ways to avoid paying taxes, which strains the state's ability to provide quality healthcare and education. Since now the economic machine now runs by the exploitation of cheap labor combined with low taxes, any attempt by political parties to increase tax will wreak havoc, since these Capitalists will not invest further or move to other places in search of tax cuts and cheap labor. So, this perpetual cycle continues, resulting in impovershed majority and extremely wealthy elites.

2. Same, even if rich wanted to go there, they will teach for free.

But in reality rich do not go to govt schools and hospitals. Why?


>Now, let's talk about the quality of both of them. Money goes to govt hospitals, corrupt management and head surgeons just distribute the money among themselves. 

What is the reason for lack of transparency? 

>
1. About not many people paying taxes because they are in private? Where did you get that from? Private companies deduct TDS, same as govt companies, 

Private sector is not just about companies. Being a doctor myself I know most of the doctors who own their clinics, they do not pay tax.

Hypothetically, if there is free healthcare for all, (of course with high taxes) quality will definitely improve and as a result no one will visit private doctors. All doctors will have to work under government and government will receive the taxes. 

>And also, I would love to see from where did you pull up that 97% number.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_sector

I know Wikipedia is not the most reliable source but you can crosscheck on any another website.
According to this wiki article, government sector was just 3.8% in 2014 and since then decreasing. 

>Also, how did you deduce that free education, healthcare means much more govt jobs? I would love to know your thoughts on this.

Take any Nordic country for example, if people pay high taxes government will be able to provide quality free education and quality free healthcare for all. That means more number of quality government schools and hospitals. Middle class people and rich people will start sending their children to government schools. I mean if I pay high taxes I definitely want to take the benefit of subsidised quality education. As a result there will be less traffic in Private schools and they will have to close those schools. So more government schools = more government jobs.

I know it's not that easy but it will have to start from somewhere. 

>Again, no, not really. Most of the teachers are uneducated because of corruption. I am from a small town in Bihar, and I have seen the ground reality.

Corruption is the result of lack of transparency and illiteracy of common people. Why there's more corruption in Bihar as compared to Kerala ?
Of course corruption is prevalent in whole India but some states are more corrupt.
Illiteracy is the reason I guess. We do not question  government. We do not seek transparency. Most of the uneducated people do not know about budget of education and healthcare. How are those people gonna seek transparency?
And since the cause is illiteracy of all the evils in India we desperately need to get more literate.
For that we need quality education and much more budget on education.
Our present government does not give a single shit about education and healthcare. And also average citizens don't really have education and healthcare as priorities. And that does not mean Congress was any better. 

>I am from general category, from a poor family (yes, not all general categories are uber rich), from a small town in Bihar. I completed my higher education from my town itself, since my parents didn't have enough money to send me to kota/delhi/patna etc. I studied hard, for 12-14 hrs daily, topped class 12th exam, got admitted in one of the top enginnering college of india, and now, I am earning more than what many people can only dream of.

If you studied 12-14 hours,  because of your in depth love for engineering that's pretty cool. But if you had to study this hard with pressure in mind to uplift your family, you are perfect example for why do we need much better education budget and free education for all even for colleges.
In my opinion everyone has right to have quality education... It's not the kids fault that his parents are poor. 

>So, no, I am in no way a failure.

I should not have said that way.
My apologies. 

>In my time, there was no EWS. But I feel EWS is the way to go forward. Also, no I don't hate reservation. They are necessary for a country like India, which has a wide gap already. But I don't like it's current structure.

Free education and healthcare will solve EWS and caste based reservation problem. Rich will pay taxes poor won't but both are getting same education means. And after some years the gap will decrease. Because same kind of education means there won't be much difference in salaries as well. So there won't rich paying for poor anymore. And since it's totally free no Caste based reservation.

So, they earn about about $1,728 per year. For them to make $10 billion or $10,000,000,000, the person needs to work about 5,787,037 years to earn that income. So, what Mukesh Ambani made in 1 year, that average family requires nearly 6 million years to make that much. Is that really fair?

Now some inequality maybe justified but 6 million times seems too much. What that average family makes in one year, Mukesh Ambani makes that much in 5 seconds.

3. The amount that CEO of a technology company makes in 10 minutes is more than what a domestic worker would make in a one year.


4. Women and girls put 3.26 billion hours of unpaid care work each day. This is equal to a contribution of atleast Rs. 19 lakh crore each year to the Indian economy.

I don't think people do not have equal access to tools, which can make their life better. It's a matter of affordability. Even the concept of decent living is debatable, how do you quantify that? Someone living in the country side may not have access to all the amenities, which qualify as decent living from an urban-dwellers perspective, but for them, they're living a pretty decent life as long as they have access to 3 basic amenities.

I guess the point you're trying to make is when someone who makes it to the top 20%, stops giving shit about the rest of the 80% -- which is also true -- but that is true among those 80% as well.

This actually hurts the poor more than it helps them. When you institute minimum wages (wage floors), businesses pass on those costs to the customer, resulting in inflated prices.

We as a society (rightly) demand a minimum standard of living for everyone, and we collectively pay for that one way or the other. Either we pay taxes to fund a welfare state, or we pay inflated prices for goods and services to maintain wage floors.

Paying taxes for welfare is more progressive, as the burden falls on richer people. Paying inflated prices for goods and services is regressive as it's a burden that falls equally on the rich and the poor.

>	Secondly, these ""Wealth creators"" demand Tax cuts and find myriad ways to avoid paying taxes, which strains the state's ability to provide quality healthcare and education. Since now the economic machine now runs by the exploitation of cheap labor combined with low taxes, any attempt by political parties to increase tax will wreak havoc, since these Capitalists will not invest further or move to other places in search of tax cuts and cheap labor.

Taxes, while required, are not a panacea. Switzerland has one of the lowest marginal tax rates in the developed world, and they get by (with healthcare and education, for rich and poor) just fine.

Some years ago you probably would have been satisfied if everyone had food and shelter but today you'd agree everyone deserves quality education, healthcare and even internet connectivity, which a few years ago only the rich to had access to, and it was acceptable because those things were then ""above the minimum standard of living"".

Sure, nobody is arguing maintaining a static minimum. Anti-poverty action can be made dynamic — you can peg it to the inflation, peg it to a minimum basket of goods index like the CPI, etc. You can also democratically move the minimum standard, just like we democratically decide tax brackets. This isn’t novel, it’s just a different way of looking at existing structures.

>	When you say that inequality is okay as long as there’s no absolute poverty, you are basically concurring to the fact that the rich can have today what the poor should have some years into the future. And I find that unacceptable.

I mean, yes? Everything starts off expensive before the market is able to optimize its production. It’s the natural progression of human progress. Air travel was once strictly an endeavor of the rich, but over time became widely available to everyone. 15 years ago, having a personal driver was considered strictly for the rich, but today even the middle class is able to push a button on an app and get a private driver. Today, having an Apple iPhone-quality phone (as opposed to a cheap Android phone), is a luxury, but today’s cheap Android phone contains the technology/features that were considered cutting edge in the 2015 iPhone. You’d have a really hard time convincing someone in the 1900’s that the poor are, in that moment, entitled to air travel. You’d have a really hard time in the early 2000’s convincing someone that, in that moment, the poor are entitled to personal drivers. You’d have a really hard time convincing, someone that, today, the poor are entitled to iPhone 11 Pro’s. Today, very few in America can afford self driving cars (Tesla). In the future, that technology may be as ubiquitous as the modern day automobile, itself.

fn4zsyi,"Regarding representation in government:

There is an infinite number of ways you can divide society up into various groups. Religion, caste, language, physical handicap, mental handicap, height, weight, skin colour, I could go on and on. Add to that the infinite number of combinations of those traits, each with a unique view of how to face the challenges unique to that sub-group.

All the parliament seats in the world couldn't accommodate even a single representative of all those unique groups. Moreover, it is not fair that a group of 10 people should have equal or greater say in the democratic process than a group of a million people. That is by definition undemocratic. Either we agree that the rights of the individual is paramount and should be protected, and thus the rights of any group, small or large, or minorities are forever doomed because they will not, and should not, have disproportional representation.

About non-government representation:

Nothing outside of government is ever about representation. You don't get a job in a company to represent your community. To say that someone should get an opportunity simple because they belong to a particular group regardless of their merit is the very definition of discrimination/racism. If the decision is to be based on merit, the entire point is moot. The best man for the job will get the job, whatever his caste is, at least if the giver of the job is a good businessman.

If society in general behaves poorly towards a certain caste, that is unfortunate, but it certainly cannot be improved by giving a small minority within the minority special opportunity. All that ensures is that those particular individuals will get subsidised education. It still doesn't mean that society will treat them differently, or indeed offer them more ""representation"". It certainly doesn't mean that the majority of people in the lower caste have anything to gain by the one kid in the neighbourhood who gets to take advantage of the reservation.

On a general level, social ills like mistreatment of certain castes cannot be wished away or legislated away.

This has less to do with inequality, and more to do with monopolies and anti-trust. I think one can argue that inequality is not inherently a problem, but monopolies are no better than central planning — equally inefficient. Also, people will consume the press that confirms their biases. The press isn’t changing people’s minds, it’s just reinforcing their priors. Even if you were to break up a press monopoly, people aren’t just going to suddenly decide to become responsible consumers and consume a wide variety of sources — they are going to just choose the outlets that confirm their priors.

Also “corporate backing” just means “more money”, and Bernie Sanders out-raised and out-spent Joe Biden, and still lost by almost 3 million votes in 2020. Hillary Clinton had [far more corporate backing](https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/contributors?id=n00000019) than [Donald Trump](https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/contributors?id=n00023864), and still lost.

> Trump blasted Amazon for paying no taxes. Said it was unacceptable. Then he passed a tax cut that made it even EASIER for Amazon to avoid paying tax, and removed none of the loop holes they were using.

Yeah but [EVERYONE got a tax cut](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/business/economy/income-tax-cut.html) — this isn’t preferential treatment for Amazon, it’s just passing a policy that everyone gets to enjoy, that Amazon also enjoys. Not everyone likes paying taxes, so tax cuts are generally easier to pass. Also, these tax cuts just reduced America’s corporate taxes in parity with the [OECD average](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLE_II1). Also, the [economic consensus] (https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/19/157047211/six-policies-economists-love-and-politicians-hate) generally favors elimination (or reduction) of the corporate income tax.

fndkfee,"> Minimum wages should be a basic right of every working person. Anything less is straight up inhuman and cruel. It hurts nobody.

We both agree that a minimum amount of money should be a basic right of every working person, but a minimum wage isn't the only way of accomplishing this — a guaranteed [basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) or a [negative income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax) are superior alternatives to accomplishing the same goal.

> Minimum labor laws exist in US and developed countries but they ensure outsourcing to poor countries due to the advantage of having a strong currency.

Let me try and explain how minimum labor laws result in regressivity.

Imagine a pizza maker's market value is (say) $5/hour. They are able to produce (for simplicity's sake) 5 pizza's per hour, or $1/pizza. Including other operating costs + 3-5% profit margin (that's the average for most restaurants), let's say that the pizza sells for $5. Thus the pizza maker can expect to earn $40/day, on the market. Suppose the ""livable minimum wage"" should be $15/hour, or $120/day. There are 2 ways to guarantee this:

A) The government deposits an extra $80 to the worker, allowing them to make $120 that day. They can buy a pizza for $5, which is about 4% of their daily wage.

B) The government mandates a minimum wage of $15/hour, which means that the labor portion of the pizza cost goes up from $1 to $3 per pizza. The pizza now sells for $7 so that the shop doesn't go out of business. The worker makes $120/day, and can buy a pizza for $7, which is about 6% of their daily wage.

Notice that in (B), the worker is actually _worse off_, even though they have the same amount of money in their pocket. The worker has to pay a higher percentage of their pay to afford to eat, but this $2 extra means _absolutely nothing_ to a billionaire, it's pennies to a rich person. This is called a [regressive tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regressivetax.asp). In scenario (A), the worker is better off, and the welfare system that sustains it can be funded through [progressive taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progressivetax.asp), which targets rich people.

The US has such a system, called the [Earned Income Tax Credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit), which is essentially a basic income for workers. It is considered one of the [most successful](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/earned-income-tax-credit-is-a-smart-way-to-help-the-working-poor/2014/01/26/02c66dba-8522-11e3-bbe5-6a2a3141e3a9_story.html) anti-poverty programs in the US. The earned income tax credit has been part of political debates in the United States over whether raising the minimum wage or increasing EITC is a [better idea](https://scholar.harvard.edu/mankiw/content/cost-living-wage). In a random survey of 568 members of the American Economic Association in 2011, roughly 60% of economists agreed that the earned income tax credit program should be expanded.

Doing this also has the added benefit of reducing out-sourcing.

> This is the kind of mindset because of which atrocities like child labor and human trafficking still exist in the world. By the extension of same logic why not have child labor to ensure consumers get much better value.

For the same reason that pedophilia is illegal. Sex between consenting adults is legal, no questions asked, but we have collectively decided that children are incapable of consenting. The same applies across the board: children lack the agency to be able to rationally be party to employment contracts. It is entirely possible to be opposed to both child labor as well as ""minimum wages"" imposed on businesses.

Whatever I'm working on, whether it's productive or not is decided by the Free Market. I maybe working hard on something, but if it's no value to anybody else, how can it be productive? 

Say, I spend 10 hours a day, collecting sea shells or pebbles on the sea shore, which are perfect sphere. Now after multiple days of hard work I collect 1000 such spheres, but I'm unable to sell any of them to anyone. No one is willing to exchange any money for any of those spheres.

fn4s5cm,">Again, Joe Biden had almost no corporate backing, and still won. It’s because he has name recognition.

before i get started, i just want to say that I have loved reading the debate you were having!

just a couple nitpicks from an american who has been watching the presidential primaries very closely.  joe biden pulled ahead without money for two reasons:

1. because Trump is a fascist who ran on a platform of racial superiority and the majority of black voters don't trust the white people of america to vote for a progressive candidate (but they need trump out for sure!)
2. all of the other democratic primary candidates besides sanders dropped out in the span of like a week before the SC primary so a large portion of the neoliberal/moderate vote flipped to biden.

no one likes joe biden. he's an imperialist, racist, sexist white, male liar with boundary problems who has run for president MANY times before without anything approaching a progressive platform, never ever made it anywhere close to the end of the primary, and is now being held up as a ragdoll so the Dems can increase their political capital by ""beating trump"".

\*cough\* sorry

the thing is that I agree with you, charisma and money is the secret blend for a successful career in politics.  considering no one is fanatically in favor of biden and trumps supporters are fed with an insanely powerful propaganda machine, if this comes down to biden v trump in november, biden is gonna get blown out of the water because he's a limp noodle that doesn't actually inspire a significant portion of the population.  the dems are trying to capture the moderate republican vote now because they nominated a rapist so actual leftists aren't going to vote for him and the moderate republicans are trying to distance themselves from the anti-lgbt, white-supremacist rhetoric and gaslighting, armtwisting, and that trump uses to maintain his voter's image of him (mostly white people, if you hadn't guessed)

you might think that with trump stealing medical supplies from the state's hospitals and other countries and his irresponsible response to coronavirus (because of which, it's causing thousands and thousands of preventable deaths), people would abandon him, but no, he just lies on television and recently tried strongarming a privately owned news station into broadcasting the entirety of his coronavirus briefings without commentary.  These press briefings last upwards of two hours every single day, typically do not contain much new information, and are mostly just a way for trump to get his face on TV as much as possible.  how were they strongarming the tv station?  by refusing to let them host our nations official epidemiologists and doctors for conversations.  they literally tried to control the narrative with power and they got that power by means of charisma in the face of a system overwhelmingly obsessed with money.

\>  Yeah but [EVERYONE got a tax cut](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/business/economy/income-tax-cut.html) — this isn’t preferential treatment for Amazon,

The idea of eliminating corporate taxes and just taxing billionaires is pretty new and interesting to me, i hadn't considered that before.

anyways, money plays a HUGE role in politics.  yes, technically bribing a politician is illegal, but it functions basically the same way here with lobbyists.  the lobbyist ""donates"" money to an organization which then, say, invites the lobbyist or their boss to an event where the Senator will surely be socializing and chatting away.  or, more directly, you are invited to lunch with The Senator for a private conversation.  The thing is, you don't need to be a lobbyist.  You just need a shitload of money, so our billionaires, millionaires, and corporations can literally just buy time with our governmental representatives.  which is more convincing on matters of policy for people who are obsessed with power (aka almost everyone in the US govt right now)?  someone giving you a ton of money and then meeting you face to face with a plan to make even more money (of which they would surely donate more!)?  or letters sent from a very small number of constituents back home that mostly likely never made it past the aide.

Senators in the USA are not obligated to listen to their constituents and tbh it's really fucking easy to lie to the American population in general (see: american exceptionalism) so ""voting them out"" doesn't really work that well in practice due to the inordinate influence of money on our politics.

I will say that money alone cannot elect a candidate.  But money can and most definitely does affect the following things:

1. narrative
2. policy

which then leads to candidates and directly influences the wielding of political power in the USA.

SO

prepare for billionaires to have undue influence over your government.  oh also, having money in america is directly tied to your ability to hire representation in the case of criminal or civil law cases.  so poor people have access to an underfunded public defender when they are accused of a crime and rich people hire a lawyer that costs $100k an hour.  What's the difference?  am i saying that public defenders cannot be good lawyers?  no, i'm saying that public defenders (who probably started  as our brightest, most idealistic lawyers) are overworked and underpaid and unlikely to be able to take significant interest in your case (or have desire to, depending on how burned out they are). so poor people are given justice at the behest of a government that already doesn't like them at all while rich people can purchase legal representation based on a resume.

\> "" This is really only true for positions that are un-elected, i.e. bureaucrats that are appointed by elected officials. ""

i do not know what role the ""administrative state"" plays in india, so if I am way off base please let me know!  i would love to learn more!

however,

as i hope i have shown, billionaires do have direct access to politicians in the USA even though bribery is illegal.  There are also clubs and schools that rich people predominately attend and participate in, so they also develop a network of nepotistic contacts all of whom have lots of power themselves.

so now you have a small group of people with a shitload of money who can directly influence policy for their benefit and purchase land, buildings, goods, labor, whatever.  if politics, and resources dont comprise power, idk what does.

Market socialism is a type of economic system involving the public, cooperative or social ownership of the means of production in the framework of a market economy. Market socialism differs from non-market socialism in that the market mechanism is utilized for the allocation of capital goods and the means of production. Depending on the specific model of market socialism, profits generated by socially owned firms (i.e. net revenue not reinvested into expanding the firm) may variously be used to directly remunerate employees, accrue to society at large as the source of public finance or be distributed amongst the population in a social dividend.Market socialism is distinguished from the concept of the mixed economy because models of market socialism are complete and self-regulating systems, unlike the mixed economy.

fn6gkib,"I haven’t forgotten you, just didn’t think this would get so in the weeds on American politics! For the record, I’m an American as well, voted in the primaries, and have been following it closely as well.

>	1. because Trump is a fascist who ran on a platform of racial superiority and the majority of black voters don't trust the white people of america to vote for a progressive candidate (but they need trump out for sure!)

Not sure what this means — majority of black people support Biden, for sure, but there’s not enough data to conclude that they only support Biden because of some distrust among white people of America to vote for a progressive candidate. That’s just conjecture.

>	2. all of the other democratic primary candidates besides sanders dropped out in the span of like a week before the SC primary so a large portion of the neoliberal/moderate vote flipped to biden.

Yes, again, the fundamental point here is that money doesn’t buy the votes. At the end of the day, the majority of the Democratic party electorate is moderate, and that majority was inevitably going to vote for the last moderate standing. No amount of money is going to change a moderate’s mind to become a left-winger, or a right-winger.

>	no one likes joe biden. he's an imperialist, racist, sexist white, male liar with boundary problems who has run for president MANY times before without anything approaching a progressive platform, never ever made it anywhere close to the end of the primary, and is now being held up as a ragdoll so the Dems can increase their political capital by ""beating trump"".

I’ll try and respond to this objectively: while you’re right that Biden doesn’t draw the level of enthusiasm that some other candidates have, he has more support *overall*. Consider that Bernie Sanders did *worse* in 2020 than in 2016, despite a higher turnout. In 2016, he won Michigan in a surprise upset. In 2020, he not only lost Michigan, he lost *every single county*. Put simply, the majority of Democrats do not support Sanders and his positions. The majority of Democrats are probably not socialists (or social democrats or democratic socialists or whatever you want to call it). That’s why Biden won. That’s also why Biden polls better against Trump than Sanders. Anecdotally, my first choice was Andrew Yang, then Klobuchar, then Pete, then Bloomberg, then Biden. No amount of money would change this.

>	the thing is that I agree with you, charisma and money is the secret blend for a successful career in politics. considering no one is fanatically in favor of biden and trumps supporters are fed with an insanely powerful propaganda machine, if this comes down to biden v trump in november, biden is gonna get blown out of the water...

Again, we just don’t know for sure who is going to win in November. Polls currently show Biden in the lead (even winning the electoral college). Polls have been wrong in the past, but they’re not ALWAYS wrong. Keep in mind that just because a candidate has fanatical supporters, that doesn’t mean that the candidate has the *majority* of supporters (see: Bernie).

>	he just lies on television and recently tried strongarming a privately owned news station into broadcasting the entirety of his coronavirus briefings without commentary. These press briefings last upwards of two hours every single day, typically do not contain much new information, and are mostly just a way for trump to get his face on TV as much as possible. how were they strongarming the tv station? by refusing to let them host our nations official epidemiologists and doctors for conversations. they literally tried to control the narrative with power and they got that power by means of charisma in the face of a system overwhelmingly obsessed with money.

The White House has no power whatsoever to prevent TV stations from ignoring & broadcasting whatever they like during WH press briefings.

>	large corporations in America do get preferential tax treatment by virtue of often not paying taxes at all :https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2019/10/10/trump-tax-cuts-helped-billionaires-pay-less-taxes-than-the-working-class-in-2018/#2d0dc2453128

That article is behind a paywall: but the gist of the article appears to be that corporations can not pay taxes at all because their “effective rate” can be made zero. Corporations’ ""effective rate"" can only be low if they reinvest their profits and spend huge amounts on research and development, i.e. good behavior that our tax code is explicitly designed to promote.

>	The idea of eliminating corporate taxes and just taxing billionaires is pretty new and interesting to me, i hadn't considered that before.

The above is also why the corporate income tax is largely unfavorable to many economists: it’s a very inefficient way of taxing the rich that also happens to dis-incentivize productive investment.

>	anyways, money plays a HUGE role in politics. yes, technically bribing a politician is illegal, but it functions basically the same way here with lobbyists. the lobbyist ""donates"" money to an organization which then, say, invites the lobbyist or their boss to an event where the Senator will surely be socializing and chatting away. or, more directly, you are invited to lunch with The Senator for a private conversation. which is more convincing on matters of policy for people who are obsessed with power (aka almost everyone in the US govt right now)? someone giving you a ton of money and then meeting you face to face with a plan to make even more money (of which they would surely donate more!)? or letters sent from a very small number of constituents back home that mostly likely never made it past the aide.

The role of money in politics is [debatable](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/). Money is certainly strongly associated with political success. But money hasn’t been shown to *cause* winning. Decades of research suggest that [money probably isn’t the deciding factor](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2605401) in who wins a general election, and especially not for incumbents. According to most of the research from the last century, [it was generally found](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002764203260415) that [spending didn’t affect wins](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-40118-8_9) for incumbents and that the [impact for challengers was unclear](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138764?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). Even the studies that showed spending having the biggest effect, like one that found a more than [6 percent increase in vote share](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/psc/clarke/214/Gerber98.pdf) for incumbents, didn’t demonstrate that money actually *causes* wins. In fact, it’s been found that those gains from spending likely translate to less of an advantage today, in a time period where voters are [more stridently partisan](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/10/05/takeaways-on-americans-growing-partisan-divide-over-political-values/). There are probably fewer and fewer people who are going to vote a split ticket because they liked a political ad. Instead, the strong raw association between raising the most cash and winning probably has more to do with big donors who can tell (based on polls or knowledge of the district or just gut-feelin) that one candidate is more likely to win — and then they give that person all their money.

We saw this play out in the 2016 Primaries, the 2016 Generals, the 2018 Mid-Terms, as well as the 2020 Primaries.

>	Senators in the USA are not obligated to listen to their constituents and tbh it's really fucking easy to lie to the American population in general (see: american exceptionalism) so ""voting them out"" doesn't really work that well in practice due to the inordinate influence of money on our politics.

I’m not sure what you mean here — Senators are elected into office by popular vote by constituents of their state. If a state doesn’t like one if its senators, that senator will be voted out. The “inordinate influence of money in our politics” has been shown not to have much of an effect (see above). If a Senator votes for (or against) policies, and the Senator continues to get re-elected, then those policies aren’t unpopular, after all. Democracy is a double-edge sword.

>	I will say that money alone cannot elect a candidate. But money can and most definitely does affect the following things:
1.	narrative
2.	policy

Money doesn’t affect policy, since policy is decided by lawmakers that are democratically elected. Per the above, money’s role in democratic elections is dubious.

You’re right about money affecting narrative, but that’s just because we have a free press. The narrative is largely set by well funded mainstream media. They are well funded because they have a lot of viewers (or readers). If you have an idea on how to regulate the press without violating the First Amendment, I’m all ears!

>Yes, again, the fundamental point here is that money doesn’t buy the votes.    


not arguing that it does.  it does affect who can effectively run for president, though:

https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/24/18009856/working-class-income-inequality-randy-bryce-alexandria-ocasio-cortez

which has a direct outcome on who is going to win the election, by virtue of mostly only being able to elect millionaires.

As well, socioeconomic background directly affects whether a politician votes in the interests of their class or other classes:

>Among Democratic and Republican members of Congress alike, those from working-class jobs are more likely than their fellow partisans to take progressive or pro-worker positions on major economic issues.

https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/24/18009856/working-class-income-inequality-randy-bryce-alexandria-ocasio-cortez


Given that you need money and time off from work to run for office and people in office tend to represent their own interests, people with money will advance policy that generates money for them. This is further explained a bit further down in the Vox article:

> These differences between politicians from different economic backgrounds — coupled with the virtual absence of politicians from the working class — ultimately skew the policymaking process toward outcomes that are more in line with the upper class’s economic interests. States with fewer legislators from the working class spend billions less on social welfare each year, offer less generous unemployment benefits, and tax corporations at lower rates. Towns with fewer working-class people on their city councils devote smaller shares of their budgets to social safety net programs; an analysis I conducted in 2013 suggested that cities nationwide would spend approximately $22.5 billion more on social assistance programs each year if their councils were made up of the same mix of classes as the people they represent.

I concede about the influence of lobbying groups and money directly affecting policy in the manner i have described,  although corporate lobbying has been shown to slightly reduce tax burden and increase revenue for those companies:

"" I find that the effect of lobbying expenditures on a policy's equilibrium enactment probability to be statistically significant but very small. Nonetheless, the average returns from lobbying expenditures are estimated to be over 130%.""

https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/83/1/269/2461194

Now, if corporations are spending money on employees and r&d, that's great!

> Corporations’ ""effective rate"" can only be low if they reinvest their profits and spend huge amounts on research and development, i.e. good behavior that our tax code is explicitly designed to promote.

Can you show me that this is true?  My understanding is that a lot of money companies make is paid out in bonuses to shareholders rather than reinvesting in research or employees:

“Point 3: Companies Are Sitting On Cash But Not Raising Wages
HR and business leaders are well aware of these financial issues, yet are afraid to raise wages.
Apple, for example, recently announced that its quarterly revenue grew to $61 billion (making it a $250 billion company) and that it generated $13.8 billion in profit (almost 23% profit). This means that for every dollar you spend on an Apple product or service, 23 cents goes to the bank.
What is Apple doing with this money? They’re returning it to the shareholders. The company announced it will distribute $210 billion to shareholders through stock buy-backs and will increase its dividend as well. If you own Apple stock, you see a good return, but if you’re an Apple employee, you may or may not see a thing. (P.S. Apple pays only a 14.5% tax rate.)”

https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2018/10/31/why-arent-wages-keeping-up-its-not-the-economy-its-management/#7a4afa00397e (if this is behind a paywall too, let me know and I'll copy-pasta the whole thing for you in a document!)

This means that, typically, wealth is becoming more and more concentrated.

So far we have agreed:

* Money alone won’t get you elected
* Money from lobbyists or billionaires does NOT have a direct, large effect on policy implementation (at least according to the studies i can find)

What I have tried to show, in addition, is that:
* Money DOES have an effect on whether or not you are able to run for president
* Money DOES affect your policy agenda once you’re in office 

> if people don’t like the policy decisions, they can just vote them out

If that was true, how could politicians whose policy agenda objectively, overwhelmingly supports the upper-middle-income socioeconomic class regardless of political party affiliation stay in office even though those views are heavily over-represented in congress compared to the population?  

It's possible that people with money make up most of America and are voting in their own self-interest.  However, as it turns out, only ~40% of the american population votes in a presidential election at any given time.  For example, the numbers for hillary and trump in the last election:

trump:
62,984,828

hillary:
65,853,514

While 30% (disproportionately poor and nonwhite) of the population abstained because they do not feel represented by the government:

> ""Those who choose not to vote — either those who are registered but do not vote or those who simply do not register — constitute a huge number of Americans. Indeed, the Post highlighted their size this way: “about 30 percent of Americans were eligible to vote but decided not to, a higher percentage than the portion of the country who voted for either Trump or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.” And while rich white people chose to vote in large numbers in the 2016 presidential election, lower-income citizens and racial minorities composed a much larger portion of those who chose not to vote.""

https://theintercept.com/2020/04/09/nonvoters-are-not-privileged-they-are-largely-lower-income-non-white-and-dissatisfied-with-the-two-parties/

Let me repeat that: a block of voters, mostly poor, larger than the voters who voted for either Trump or Hillary do not feel that any candidates, democratic or republican, represent their interests and have not for a long time.  And they are right.

To show that the current status quo in federal government is not tenable for people who are poor and/or working class, I posit that they are voting against their own interests when they do choose to vote.  To explain:

I’m sure you’ve seen this graph before relating gdp to wage stagnation: https://aneconomicsense.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/real-gdp-per-capita-median-weekly-earnings-1980-2013.png

There is strong evidence that wage stagnation is caused by unequal distribution of economic output which has been growing steadily worse since the the 1980’s:

https://www.brookings.edu/research/thirteen-facts-about-wage-growth/
https://aneconomicsense.org/2015/02/13/why-wages-have-stagnated-while-gdp-has-grown-the-proximate-factors/

Why isn’t it being distributed?

From wiki:

""Causes of inequality may include executive compensation increasing relative to the average worker, financialization, greater industry concentration, lower unionization rates, lower effective tax rates on higher incomes, and technology changes that reward higher educational attainment.”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States

So overall, you have a class of people with money who create policy for themselves and their moneyed interests while non-moneyed people are earning low (non-livable) wages but are still expected to afford, say, healthcare.  Despite this, people still vote for these parties even though their real wages have not kept pace with the salaries of CEO's and our social safety nets barely exist no matter which government (dem/repub) has been in power.

To summarize my view so far:

Having billionaires is not unethical.  Having billionaires while others are starving and dying due to lack of economic resources and healthcare is unethical.  The income inequality gap will not go away on its own, has been growing steadily for 40 years no matter which party is president, and is a direct result of small decisions made over the last 40 years by the leaders of corporations and governments. The leaders of corporations and governments are far more likely to be moneyed compared to the average american and thus they generate a system more fair to people with money than people without.  This creates (along with race, etc.) institutional issues that serve to reinforce the narrative that poor people are poor because they didnt try hard enough and rich people are rich because they are inherently more valuable and better than a poor person because of their economic activities, which is false on many counts.

To be clear, I agree that a free market is the best way to produce profit and generate wealth. It sounds like India emerged from market price fixing or something?  Anyways, the free market on its own is a bad way to ensure that wealth is distributed fairly and all people are treated with respect.

To grab some of your other points:

> The White House has no power whatsoever to prevent TV stations from ignoring & broadcasting whatever they like during WH press briefings.

While this is true, I was not arguing that.

> Corporations’ ""effective rate"" can only be low if they reinvest their profits and spend huge amounts on research and development, i.e. good behavior that our tax code is explicitly designed to promote.

Can you show me that this is true?  My understanding is that a lot of money companies make is paid out in bonuses to shareholders rather than reinvesting in research or employees:

“Point 3: Companies Are Sitting On Cash But Not Raising Wages
HR and business leaders are well aware of these financial issues, yet are afraid to raise wages.
Apple, for example, recently announced that its quarterly revenue grew to $61 billion (making it a $250 billion company) and that it generated $13.8 billion in profit (almost 23% profit). This means that for every dollar you spend on an Apple product or service, 23 cents goes to the bank.
What is Apple doing with this money? They’re returning it to the shareholders. The company announced it will distribute $210 billion to shareholders through stock buy-backs and will increase its dividend as well. If you own Apple stock, you see a good return, but if you’re an Apple employee, you may or may not see a thing. (P.S. Apple pays only a 14.5% tax rate.)”

https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2018/10/31/why-arent-wages-keeping-up-its-not-the-economy-its-management/#7a4afa00397e

And the wellbeing of shareholders is almost perfectly useless to describe the welfare of the nation since the stock market has been going “up” the entire time income inequality has been increasing in America.

My point was an attempt to illustrate (poorly) the unequal standing that rich and poor people have in this society even when it comes to the justice system, which plays a central role in why the poor stay poor:

>  If you have an idea on how to regulate the press without violating the First Amendment, I’m all ears!

Unfortunately, i don’t have any ideas in this regard and it's a huge question.  However, i don’t think that means we should ignore the influence that money has on our nation’s narratives, even for nonprofit-funded publications:

https://archives.cjr.org/essay/money_changes_everything.php

> Money doesn’t affect policy, since policy is decided by lawmakers that are democratically elected.

This is probably false due to the socioeconomic effect I pointed out earlier and: 

""The data also reveal the persistent bias in favor of the status quo in American policymaking. As Grossman notes, “Only 14 of the 50 proposals were adopted, even though the rich were more supportive than the middle class in over half of the proposals.” Over the full data set, Gilens notes that even in cases of when the overwhelming majority of the public supported a policy, the policy change was achieved only 43 percent of the time. Status quo bias overwhelmingly benefits the rich.""

http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2016/2/how-the-rich-control-policymaking.html

In America, the status quo has been shifting further right overtime with lies about self-regulating free markets and the benevolence of rich people.  As we say when our economy gets bailed out, ""socialism for the banks, capitalism for the poor"".

So now that Trump is threatening the status quo in some ways, we might see turnout for the Dems but I'm not holding my breath, obviously.  True, the dems could pull the moderate-right vote since even Fox News has taken to criticizing trump's actions on occasion now, apparently:

fn7da8k,"**Income inequality in the United States**

Income inequality in the United States is the extent to which income is distributed in an uneven manner among the American population. It has fluctuated considerably since measurements began around 1915, moving in an arc between peaks in the 1920s and 2000s, with a 30-year period of relatively lower inequality between 1950–1980.

The U.S. has the highest level of income inequality among its (post-)industrialized peers. When measured for all households, U.S. income inequality is comparable to other developed countries before taxes and transfers, but is among the highest after taxes and transfers, meaning the U.S. shifts relatively less income from higher income households to lower income households.

You said the reason the market valued the “productivity “/labour of an investor more than that of a worker is because they take a higher risk. I just pointed out that the higher risk (which is incredibly easy for them to mitigate) is only that they will become a worker and it is in fact the worker who takes the higher risk every day of his life.",2,8,1586613664.0,PMYOUMYTITS,False,negative,neutral,negative,negative
