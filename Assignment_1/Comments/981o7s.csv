EDIT: Woke up to see this rapidly went out of my *aukaat*, so [here's my meager donation to the cause](https://imgur.com/a/CJykel3). I hope my brothers and sisters from Kerala can forgive me. 

As compensation, I'm going to spend the rest of today and tomorrow volunteering in the collection drives around Hyderabad. If anyone is in town, do come by and drop off anything you can spare. Packaged food, blankets, sanitary pads, and of course water bottles. They never have enough water during the floods. I remember how there were people charging 1000 rupees a bottle during the Uttarakhand floods. 

I will also be asking my friends to donate as much as they can. Cheers and I hope the storm blows over quickly. ",1238,0,1534512825.0,DudeWheresThePorn,1534562185.0,neutral,neutral,positive,neutral

e4d2pl5,"I see several people confused in some other threads on how rain can cause so much damage. I can understand your thoughts as most places do not see this much rain. So, I will explain.

During normal years, Kerala receives the largest rainfall among all major states in India. For comparison, the nearby Tamil Nadu gets 945mm rainfall annually, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Himachal pradesh, Andhra pradesh, MP, J&K, UP, Bihar etc gets some 900mm to 1200mm range rainfall. Haryana, Delhi, Punjab etc get 350mm to 700mm...

If compared with US, california gets 570mm, Iowa gets 850mm, Kentucky	gets 1200mm, Kanas gets 900mm and in general most of USA gets under 1000mm, with the highest being Hawaii at 1600mm. Average for UK is around 850mm. Average for France is 600mm,

Meanwhile the Indian state of Kerala gets about 3000mm average rainfall during ""normal years"". So, by default it is a very rainy place.

Now, what is Kerala(for non Indians). It can be considered as the most developed state of India, with Human development Index more comparable to Europe than to rest of Indian states. It has 100% literacy rates, reasonably good infrastructure and everything is far better than most places in India. Kerala is well known for its natural scenic beauty with [serene backwaters](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=kerala+tourism&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiMsKLRh_TcAhUSfX0KHe3SAHUQ_AUICigB&biw=1229&bih=638) and [cool hills](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=munnar&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiu6rn2h_TcAhUGU30KHR22DrsQ_AUIDCgD&biw=1229&bih=638).

This time, there is non stop rain every few hours daily for like past three months, and that too very strongly.. it is record rain never seen before... most likely it will go in history as the highest rain ever in kerala. Some dam shutters which were NEVER opened in past 40 years had to be opened, and still it is overflowing.

What is the strongest rain you have ever seen? At my place, that strongest rain is continuously falling for past 95 hours straight non-stop... and even before that it was raining heavily every few hours. Even now, it is raining heavily outside. My well has twice more water now than ever seen in history of that well(past 60+years).

We are receiving some 300 to 800% more rain per day than **OUR** normal, throughout the entire state. [source](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/natural-disasters/kerala-received-316-more-rainfall-than-normal-on-august-8-imd-61362)... Think of the heaviest rain you have seen, now think of it with 5 times more intensity, now imagine that rain happening every few hours daily for past 90 days and now you get a picture of what is happening here. The last time a similar sized rain happened was in **1924**, and at that time the entire state had flooded with immense loss. It was so bad that there is a wikipedia entry about it - [Great flood of 99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_flood_of_99). This time, it could be more intense than that.

The shutters of 35 of the 39 humongous dams in Kerala, including the 123-year-old *Mullaperiyar Dam*, largest earthen dam in India - *Banasura Sagar Dam*, largest reservoir of Kerala - *Malampuzha dam,* highest arch dam of Asia - *Idukki dam* etc have been opened simultaneously for the first time in history. The remaining ones are about to be opened.

And, remember that we are talking about an entire state which is adjacent to the Arabian sea, so most places in Kerala are just barely above sea-level. In fact, the lowest altitude in entire India is in Kuttanad, Kerala and that is **-7.2feet**. That is negative altitude which means it is land which is below sea level.

In so many such places, water **CANNOT** go anywhere. Water which fall on the ground will not go inside earth, instead even if it is not raining, the water will come upwards from the ground even if you cover all sides with walls and drains.

The Kochi airport, which is the fourth busiest airport in India by international traffic, has been shut down till August 26 due to this problem. Its elevation is mere 5m from sea level, and water is not going down into earth, so the runway has been flooded!

Now, how do people die due to rain? Most of the deaths are due to landslides caused by the rain, or houses collapsing due to rain taking away the foundation of the house. Few people have have drowned and few have been electrocuted, but those cases are rare.

The death toll is around 175 as of now. This is not as high as some other disaster struck zones around the world because Kerala is a pretty well managed state, and is perhaps the best state in India to handle heavy rainfall and floods, as rain is usual for Kerala and so everything is designed around it with age-old drainage systems throughout the state. But, every system has a limit, and that limit has been far exceeded now.

The government also handled the situation very well with optimally opening dams and conducting the rescue operation and evacuation at the right time. However, the loss to the state is immense, with the current estimate going over 8000 crore.

So, when Kerala says rains are heavy, the rains are really really heavy, and we are talking about catastrophic levels.

Roads are damaged, mobile phone networks are down, an international airport has been closed and more than 220,000 people have been left homeless after unusually heavy rain in the past nine days.

Officials repeatedly revised the death toll upwards from 86 people on Friday morning to more than 300 by the evening as a massive rescue operation reached more flood-hit regions. “Around 100 people died in the last 36 hours alone,” a state official said.

Casualty numbers are expected to increase further, with thousands more people still stranded and less intense though still heavy rain forecast for at least the next 24 hours. Many have died from being buried in hundreds of landslides set off by the flooding.

But, this post is infinitely more useful than the 'oh look at this pretty photo (I took or I lifted from the internet)' threads. And about admins, yeah, they need to focus on cleaning reddit and get rid of hateful fucks that pose actual threat against people. They should focus on subs dedicated on harassing people. They should focus on subs accommodating and/or encouraging bigotry in the guise of free speech and/or dark humor. This harmless post, an attempt at raising awareness towards actual suffering of actual people should be fine. It ought to be anyway. </rant>

If you are unable to donate money, contribute by giving away necessary goods for relief camps. There are various drop points being opened all across major cities by various NGOs.

More than 324 people have died in the worst flooding in nearly a century in the south Indian state of Kerala.

Roads are damaged, mobile phone networks are down, an international airport has been closed and more than 220,000 people have been left homeless after unusually heavy rain in the past nine days.

Officials repeatedly revised the death toll upwards from 86 people on Friday morning to more than 300 by the evening as a massive rescue operation reached more flood-hit regions. “Around 100 people died in the last 36 hours alone,” a state official said.

Casualty numbers are expected to increase further, with thousands more people still stranded and less intense though still heavy rain forecast for at least the next 24 hours. Many have died from being buried in hundreds of landslides set off by the flooding.

I worked in Bangalore at that time, and managed to convince my colleagues to donate nearly 50k. I also managed to convince 10 of them to come along with me to Chennai that weekend to help. 

This comes with a caveat. The situation might be too grave in some places for non-military or non-professionals to go in aid. We might do more harm than good. But we can always do grunt work at the relief centers. Just basic cooking, organizing, putting together relief packs etc need as many hands as can be gathered. 

Digressing a bit - as a Tamizhan in Karnataka at that time, I received so much support, love, and understanding from not just kannadigas, but all the people who worked with me. I know for a fact that people from Kerala did travel to Chennai and Cuddalore to help.

>'Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. **And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.**'
