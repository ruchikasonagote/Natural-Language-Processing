foyu4rv,"I am not an avid watcher of Bollywood films(or films in general) or neither have I watched a lot of Irrfan Khan's movies. But he is the only actor/celebrity/public figure whose death has saddened me to this extent. I feel angry and devastated after hearing of his demise. This loss feels very personal to me. 

I haven't watched even 10 of his movie but I have always loved this actor and have had massive respect towards him. That just shows how amazing of an actor he was and how personal his acting felt.

I woke up at 1 pm today and the first thing I saw was a WhatsApp story that said "" You left us too early and the world had to see so much of you. Rest in peace, Irrfan."" I was in shock and I was continuously wishing inside ""Please don't be Irrfan Khan"". I saw another story and my heart started aching. I just got the same feeling again right when I opened Reddit and subsequently opened this post to read the comments. I couldn't even read any further.

I was never a fan of him, but I love him. Does that even make sense? I don't know because it doesn't make sense to me either. But I will never be able to feel okay about him not being there anymore. I will never be able to feel okay about NOT being a fan of him and showing him some love while he was alive and delivering great characters to our personal lives.

I didn't know where I could vent all this so thank you for reading this and thank you for your good thoughts of Irrfan.
