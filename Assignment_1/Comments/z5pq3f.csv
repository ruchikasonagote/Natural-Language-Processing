ixxx9q5,"Wait a minute....!! So you basically want the people to ""know the truth "", but you yourself don't know any truth.

If it was because of something that college was responsible for, then I understand that it should be talked about. But if that's not the case, what's the point of this? Yes, college has no right to decide what students talk about on social media, unless they are telling lies.

But in this case, what is even the point? All you have are speculations. Which will only hit the college's image, and in turn your market worth as well.

You should at least be clear about what you are rebelling against. If you think that you or someone else knows anything, that may be useful to investigate that, share it with the student's parents.(someone among his batchmates, roommates, would know their number). If the college is trying to hush down investigation, you should raise your voice against that. Trying to hush down the chatter might be irritating, but sometimes necessary, given that unnecessary rumours might be actually painful for his friends, parents, etc, especially if they end up in news. Think of how would you feel if someone in your family committed suicide, and then you hear random rumours that he was involved in drug/human trafficking, or made a girl pregnant/became pregnant, and hence committed suicide.

All this just because some kids with too much time on their hands, wanted to gossip.

It's ""died by suicide"". This is because the recent iteration of the mental health care act decriminalizes suicide and does not consider it a crime. By saying committed we're still using the old nomenclature. It's important because the decriminalization of suicide was a very significant milestone, and the words ""died by suicide"" have the right kind of implications, which is that this is part of a wider mental health issue and needs to be talked about in those terms, rather than blaming it on the victim.

I don't know where this myth spread from(probably movies), but it's far from truth. The cyanide needs to reach most of your tissues, enter into the cell, distrupt your cellular level energy production which will lead to cell death. Sufficient number of cells needs to die for the person who consumed the cyanide pill to die and this can take anywhere from 30-60 minutes depending on dose, height, weight etc.

When you cells start dying, you will display different symptoms, and most definitely not a pleasant experience. I can't comment on the pain, but the person will fast lose consciousness and won't feel much pain.

ixzamyh,"I know exactly what you mean. I've had a rather turbulent start to my life as well so I can empathise. While not struggling academically throughout, I've certainly had my share of early successes and later failures on that front. I signed up for the UPSC and threw away a stable corporate career (15 lpa out of college despite my relatively low grades) along with three years of my life chasing a pipe dream. Getting back from that was tough and while I could certainly draw on past successes, it was the recent stinging failures, both academic and UPSC related, that loomed in my mind and dominated my emotions. There was also the recurring thought that perhaps all my past successes were flukes where I'd just gotten lucky by being at the right place at the right time. A lot of this was because of how I was perceived because of my grades in college or, perhaps even more than that, how I perceived myself because of the conditioning I'd had throughout my academic life. 

I started working after giving up on the UPSC and it took me years to find my confidence and stability again. I'm self-employed in a field which has a huge supply demand mismatch and most customers are wary about paying more than the bare minimum they are accustomed to due to the abysmal quality almost across the board. Inevitably, your confidence and assessment of and faith in your skills and abilities plays a big role in what you can charge.

For the first few years I kept under charging clients because I didn't respect myself because of my failures. Professional successes, surprising at first due to my low morale, helped build my confidence back and it was only then that I realised that my college grades or my performance in an unrelated competitive exam had no bearing on my professional abilities and that I just had to persevere through it. It's been a few years since and I've recovered my confidence in my abilities and learnt to value my abilities independent of the relative success of some of my more academically successful peers.

If anyone is contemplating the unthinkable because of academic issues, the person I'm replying to is absolutely correct. Please remember that your academic performance is irrelevant in the long term. Perseverance and ambition coupled with confidence will get you much further than grades. Don't let you academic performance undermine your confidence and ambition like I did. Some of the most academically successful people I went to school and college with have careers which appear to be going no where because they aren't passionate about what they're doing or lack the ambition to take risks. This is, however, not to shame them in anyway - there's nothing wrong with stability and passion isn't a prerequisite for having a healthy professional life. It's perfectly fine to use that stability to focus on whatever you care about, be it family, hobbies, or anything in between. More importantly, though, please note that people who flunked exams or did poorly and were written off by the more conventional grade oriented people have found success despite all odds. Persevere, be confident, and, above all else, be ambitious. Nothing can hold you back, least of all your grades.",3,4,1669564162.0,amluchon,False,negative,neutral,negative,negative

And vice versa for both of those cases. It’s random.

I think this is one of those things where we need to blame the education system and general culture around education. It's not that academics are given primacy, it's that they are treated as the only metric for success even though they are extremely limited in what they test and prepare you for relative to, well, what life is all about. Unfortunately, many young students never make it out of this initial academic tunnel to realise that there are an almost infinite number of roads and highways taking off from its end. No two journeys are entirely alike and no one goes through life linearly despite what our academic careers may have led us to believe. The almost equally tragic ones are those who make it out of that tunnel but have permanent blinkers on and fail to see opportunities as they go by because of their own self doubt, lack of self confidence, and, consequently, ambition all of which comes from the conditioning that their past failures or partial successes define their futures.

Regarding your comment about it being random, I wouldn't say it's random as much as it's entirely dependent on if and when these people realise that there's more than one path to success and that life isn't limited to only the academic tunnel they've been conditioned to during the formative two decades of their life. Even some of the successful ones are disappointed when they arrive at the destinations they've been working towards their entire lives only to realise that in the pursuit of said destinations they forgot to be humans along the way

I see so many of my friends with nice well paying jobs struggling to find something to keep them occupied when they aren't working and lacking in passion for what they are working on. Very often it's the same story - they had to choose between a well paying societally acceptable job or a high risk passion project at a start up and they ended up choosing the former because of what they'd been conditioned to believe. That's fine for people who want to focus on other things but for so many of these incredibly talented people it's just a passionless job where they clock in and clock out without really caring very much for what they're doing. I think the lack of self awareness and confidence to act on it, that is to say knowing what **you** want versus what **others** think is successful and your willingness to prioritise your own assessment over the societal expectations, plays a key role in this.

>This is the kind of mentality that makes you win at life. Very well said!

The 'solutions' you mention all work for normal healthy people, he might've not been so privileged to have good mental health, or any options to reach out to people. 

Cheating is such a minor offence, it doesn't affect anyone in any way. Not like he was gonna top the class or steal someone's grade by just copying.

ixy5ftg,I just answered comment above me to explain why cheating is NOT okay or the ONLY way. VIT is prestigious college and I'm pretty sure rules are already known before you took admission. Why go somewhere where you cannot handle? There are plenty colleges out there who gives free pass for cheating. Go there...cheat your way out of exams. And honestly if one can't handle a setbacks then well it's highly unlikely it wouldn't have happened in future. I think even you know there are even major setbacks to come in life. I'm not saying it's not sad that he died. But it was his choice to do things this way. That's all I meant.,-5,9,1669535703.0,Downtown-Body7841,False,negative,negative,neutral,negative

ixxwx4a,"No i dont respect anyone's choice who murders themselves.
They leave a lot of people sad n alone.
Have u seen someone commit suicide. Have u ever tried committing suicide?

Guess not.

Ur language n ur anger is misplaced cos u think ur ooh so perfect language and google skills give u the upperhand in communicating however nastily u want with whoever u want to u.

U may be depressed internally but the internet is giving u a chance to be vile and troll whoever u wish to.

I have seen suicides happen in families and there always was a reason.
Sadly at times it was dickweeds like u, who tried to shame or embarass someone for no reason.

Yes some people arent as strong mentally as they tend to be physically.

Some people dont even speak about their real age online and speaking with teenagers in a vile manner have larger repercussions than to an adult.

U Sir, are a classic piece of dog turd which was pooped ages ago but now u think you r fit for a museum cos you have a sense of entitlement due to your so what immaculate English Language skills and awesome search engine skills.

Hope u find ur peace and u r not this in ur real life. If yes, kindly encage urself as u r dangerous n can cause more trouble than u actually think u can.",1,2,1669529075.0,IncreaseSlow252,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

ixyl99l,"Really. I have to explain that as well? It affects all the people who studied fairly without cheating. It affects every student who stayed up all night studying to pass/ score better. As it's unfair to them. Then they might as well have cheated. And if everyone is allowed to cheat why bother to take exam at all? Just declare everyone pass with 100% score who cares that student didn't learn shit about subject which was the aim of exam. (You'll say oh they could learn by attending classes without exams if they could have then he should have known the answer and didn't needed to cheat) Just allocate the degree to the kids when they were born and be done with it. Especially disabled people. I never saw anybody giving free pass to disabled kids because they can't see, hear or even don't have hands to write or flip pages of book. Allowing cheating is not solution or good thing. You need to fix the stigma around failures and high score. You need to realise and teach how learning skills is more important than scoring in some exam. And funny thing is You can't become skilled through cheating. All you become is cheater with temporary solution. College wasn't wrong to have harsh punishment if you do something immoral. You should have thought about it when you decide to take immoral path and be ready for consequences if things go south.",1,4,1669549523.0,Downtown-Body7841,False,negative,negative,negative,negative
