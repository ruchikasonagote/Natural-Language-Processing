I am not a congress supporter. Most of us aren’t, but the other day I saw a video post about RaGa talking about the covid wave in 2020 as a tsunami and how elected officials were ridiculing him. And in that video you had the comment from Delhi HC which noted that the second wave is a tsunami in 2021.
