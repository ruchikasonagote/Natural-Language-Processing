- Solid waste mismanagement. Not heat-specific, but see that pile of garbage burning? That's because city government was supposed to set up waste management system and failed completely.

- Economic policies. For decades the government has led us to believe that A/C are luxuries for very rich. Let's tax them. Bitch, in a country where temps routinely exceed 40C, it's a necessity, not luxury.

- Power generation. Instead of relying on coal, the power policy should have pushed for renewables. Plus transmission and distribution is in shambles. Result : 4 hour/day power. You can blame the union power minister for this.

- Building codes, or lack of thereof. Even when you have A/C and power to run it, it takes a *lot* of energy to cool your home. This is because your house is not well insulated. The city govt. should have enforced building codes. They failed and developers made cheapest homes possible.

- Poor planning. Instead of green spaces, the city let unauthorized buildings grab every little available space. The concrete jungle is a virtual furnace now.

- Finally, we can blame the govt., but who put them in office? You voted, did you or did you not?",3,0,1651291538.0,hissnspit,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

It only allows you to live with the disease even if your standard of life is hugely compromised. Our two epics Mahabharata and Ramayana are basically stories of war. Have you heard of even one character in the two epics who lived without limbs -- an invalid life. Just check if there is even one character. Mahabharata in its own story says over 70 per cent of India's youth was killed in that war. Today you see so many ex-armymen especially in the US who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and other conflict zones living without parts of their body. In spite of Ayurveda and a fascinating array of medicines of that time which made people more healthy there was no life-saving medicine or treatment for soldiers hurt in war. That's how population was controlled. It was survival of the fittest in the most contended way. Everyone had enough to eat and drink.

In 1881 the British held the first census in India which revealed that India's population in 1881 was 23-crore. In the 80s it became 76-crore. Today it is over 130-crore. Look at how the population grew in India with modern medicine. More than half the population are severely sick but stay alive with modern medicine. Now understand the import of this. In India ayurveda did not have any condom. But every married couple had over ten children. Most of them would die of disease, accident or war. So from time immemorial till 1881 the population of India was only 23-crore. After that with the advent of modern medicine the population grew over five times in one century. These are the nuances of better living before British came to India.

Lastly, I don't want to win this argument with you trying to prove that I am 'so intelligent.' We are all in this sinking ship. Even I don't want to go back in my lifestyle.

Great example. Do you know what happened with Jumeirah Beach Residence, Palm Jumeirah and International City in Dubai? Where did the money to built such a stupid mega project come from? From petrodollars and government funds. Does anyone regret losing money in these projects? No one. At least not the super rich. The super rich is far too smart to lose money.

This is the crux of the issue.

i6sfkks,"> You are making a somewhat Malthusian argument that the human population will grow to take advantage of the resources offered to it. But the declining birth rates and population not just in the west but also in India's own TFR rate proves you wrong.

Over population of any species can be dangerous for the ecosystem, that's why nature takes care of population explosion. As I said earlier lesbians and gays have become so common these days which is one of nature's way of controlling population. But the speed in population drop is simply not enough. Modern healthcare does not allow most sick people to die. Birth rates going down only means the growth has come down albeit marginally, it does not mean birth rates have become negative. Even I wish nature has more ways of controlling population.

> Our population is not a problem, only eco-fascists would think that the destitute villager or slum dweller from India is a problem more than the average westerner who drives a car to work every day and generally lives a much more consumerist lifestyle.

Here you're absolutely right. The real problem is not with poor people and poverty. In India for millennia after millennia the entire population lived on hand-to-mouth existence. Subsistence farming was a norm. Money and rich people anywhere in the world are the real threat to the planet. But none of us would openly say that because the rich are our role models. Today I read a report about how trillions of dollars have been stolen from the exchequer in the name of anti-Covid measures, rehabs and helping the poor. And who has stolen this amount -- big corporations. But big corporations are our darling.

Secondly, about indigent and village residents it has been made abundantly clear by environmentalists that slum dwellers have the most sustainable lifestyle because they don't waste anything. They even reuse everything. They don't waste food, their shopping is always frugal and consumption pattern is always need-based. For instance, you will not see slum dwellers (at least in India) buying a dozen large bottles of Coke and Pepsi during grocery shopping in a mall. Only the middle class would do that.

I think I may have been unclear. Greenhouse gas is an umbrella term for every type of gas in our atmosphere that warms our planet. CO2 is a type of greenhouse gas. Other greenhouse gases include methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor. I will use CO2 from now on to be more clear

And in India they do mostly come from industries, not from transport, which was my point originally when I said that only 13.5% of CO2 emissions in India come from the transportation sector.

My argument is that climate change is exacerbating these heat waves in India. And it's not really India's fault, since developed countries have emitted far more greenhouse gases than countries like India. India has 17% of the world's population yet has contributed only 3% of total historical CO2 emissions.You seem to disagree with this when the evidence is quite clear.",0,8,1651299700.0,sixbucks,False,negative,neutral,neutral,neutral
