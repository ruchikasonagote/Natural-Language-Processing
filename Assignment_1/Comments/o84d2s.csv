h32ym53,"Believe the regiment is the 129th Duke of Connaughts Own Baluchis (now 11th Battalion of the Pakistani Baloch Regiment) and the soldiers are from the Punjabi Muslim company. The first Indian Victoria Cross recipient, [Khudadad Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khudadad_Khan?wprov=sfti1) was from this Regiment. 129th D.C.O. Baluch was one of the first Indian infantry regiments to land in France, along with the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs (now 2nd Battalion Sikh Regiment of the Indian army).

Despite the name “Baluchis”, many other communities served in Baluch regiments. Such as Sikhs, Hazaras, Pathans and a few other communities. Ironically, during World War One, no Baluch people were recruited in the Baluch regiments. The majority of soldiers were Punjabi Muslims. I’m Sikh and both of my father’s grandfathers served in Baluch regiments. 124th Duchess of Connaught’s own Baluchistan Infantry and 126th Baluchistan Infantry, respectively.",151,0,1624688638.0,ryuguy,1624693231.0,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

h32vp9h,"As many as 74,187 Indian soldiers died during the war and a comparable number were wounded. Their stories, and their heroism, have long been omitted from popular histories of the war, or relegated to the footnotes. India contributed a number of divisions and brigades to the European, Mediterranean, Mesopotamian, North African and East African theatres of war. In Europe, Indian soldiers were among the first victims who suffered the horrors of the trenches. They were killed in droves before the war was into its second year and bore the brunt of many a German offensive. It was Indian jawans (junior soldiers) who stopped the German advance at Ypres in the autumn of 1914, soon after the war broke out, while the British were still recruiting and training their own forces. Hundreds were killed in a gallant but futile engagement at Neuve Chappelle. More than 1,000 of them died at Gallipoli, thanks to Churchill's folly. Nearly 700,000 Indian sepoys (infantry privates) fought in Mesopotamia against the Ottoman Empire, Germany's ally, many of them Indian Muslims taking up arms against their co-religionists in defence of the British Empire. The most painful experiences were those of soldiers fighting in the trenches of Europe. Letters sent by Indian soldiers in France and Belgium to their family members in their villages back home speak an evocative language of cultural dislocation and tragedy. ""The shells are pouring like rain in the monsoon,"" declared one. ""The corpses cover the country, like sheaves of harvested corn,"" wrote another. Approximately 1.3 million Indian soldiers served in World War One, and over 74,000 of them lost their lives.",708,1,1624686222.0,yashrivastava,False,negative,negative,negative,negative

h33749p,"Indian soldiers literally played a huge role in the world war 2 with as many as 2.5 million soldiers fighting the war, the largest division by far. And people seem to remember World War 2 just as that that took place in Europe, against Hitler - completely forgetting that Japan was an equally monstrous regime that by some estimates, killed more people than Nazi Germany. They literally created havoc in the east and no western power batted an eye. 

Battle of Normandy is considered as one of the deadliest battle of WW2, with 29000 casualties, while the Battle of Imphal had 59000 casualties. Double the figure of the casualties in the battle of Normandy. 

But I bet 99% of you reading this never heard about it. I, too, was completely fucked out of my mind when I learned about this. 

NOT ONE POPULAR MEDIA REPRESENTATION. NONE AT ALL. When you Google about this you'll find articles by BBC, Nytimes, Deccan Herald, and other popular media outlets - yet the role of Indian soldiers is largely forgotten. Because all they've done is just fulfilled their criteria of covering the news. No true coverage has actually been done on this topic. No famous movie, no famous book, no famous documentary. 

The battle of Imphal was voted as the most decisive battle for the British ahead of the D-day by the National War Museum. Yet we know nothing about it. And the world most definitely doesn't. 

I'm sorry if I went a little overboard but I'm a huge history buff and have watched countless WW2 documentaries and movies. So you might imagine my anger and pain to learn our brothers and sisters contribution forgotten in what is considered the most important events in modern history. 

I request OP to put this in other subs and more people come to know about this. It's what our soldiers deserve. It is my lifelong dream to make a film on this topic and show the world.

To the extent that the United States' contributions to the war primarily took the form of sheer industrial might and ability to train and deploy personnel.

But that was less the case in the European theater, where strategy had to account for distinctions between different allied combatant nations. Also the European nations, already fighting before the United States entered, laid much of the groundwork for the mode of combat on the western front. Hence d-day featured a strategy which looked very different from American landings in the Pacific. 

And regardless of theater, the United States never fought using quite the same strategy as the USSR, despite having an even larger population. First off, the United States was fighting a war of power projection in both theaters, and 'waves of men' type strategies typically work better on home terrain. Also it just wasn't necessary for the United States to sacrifice men at the same scale as the USSR did. For the USSR, soldiers were their largest resource at the time.

America was producing a massive number of warships and they were better able to protect their convoys from U-boats. Germany was running on fumes.
