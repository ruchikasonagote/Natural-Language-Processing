Many criticize corrupt dark-skinned politicians, not just for their corruption, but also go on and mock their dark skin color equating dark-skin with corruption/low-moral-values/stupidity etc. It's common even in South India! (for example, HD Kumaraswamy in Karanataka.)

A victim of sexual assault/rape/other violence gets very less media attention if she is dark-skinned (of course, unless the case is is a proxy for attacking a different problem like misgovernance, but the face of the victim will not be shown much though).

(2nd most common)- 'he is so fair and rosey.' (i have cheeks that are kinda always on blush mode, and a am quite fair, nearly too fair for an indian)

&#x200B;

3.(3rd most common)- 'congrats u have got a boy, now he can carry ur legacy forward' this one pisses me off the most coz thats so sexist and its so wrong for anybody to say, tho this one mostly did not come from family members but from far relatives, and some others. 

&#x200B;

Least common-  omggg. my cousin is so cutteeeee. this one came mainly from the younger people, mostly less than the ones who were 20yo. i have 18 cousins older than me. and im the youngest person in my generation and also the first to be born in the 2000's.

actually what i wanna convey through this post is that indian society ho matter how educated (my family is quite well educated) is very sexist and racist and despite i had more positive comments than negative comments for me, its still kinda sad as i feel that one can be racist towards someone who meets 'society ideals', and it actually brings more criticism than not, because people are constantly trying to nitpick the bad qualities in u because of ig jealousy",1,0,1617434338.0,,False,negative,negative,neutral,negative

It's not racism because we Indians compare shades of brown. Even gora/chitta/white/dhola colour means lighter brown colour.
Secondly, we cannot change liking something. People have favorites, like favorite colour, favourite food etc. As a guy I prefer both brown girls and gori(light colored) girls. I cannot change what I like or not. So talking about colour is not bad. Racism is bad because of the plight of black people in earlier centuries. Not because they are black.

Dark skin means that the person probably works out in the fields or does a lot of menial labour under the scorching heat of the sun. Fair skin means that the person can afford to not do menial jobs and instead work in service-based industries that don't usually require you to expose yourself to the sun too much.

So, fair skin=wealthier=more stability=attractive.

Extremely stupid, I know. But that is how I have noticed that people who discriminate usually think about it.

Goddess Kali, Shiva and so many other gods are never light skinned! In fact in southern India so many goddesses like Mariyamma, Chamundeshwari etc. are described as dark skinned and beautiful. Draupadi is described as most beautiful women in Mahabharatam even though she‚Äôs dark skinned.

If it becomes a problem, the baby's color is just their way of showing their lack of acceptance of a mixed race marriage IMO. And people like that are noise that I can do without.

 You should be able to acknowledge people as attractive even if you aren't into them and that's the only sign that your definition of what's attractive isn't based purely on the beauty standards of the country, if that makes sense (?) For example, I'd acknowledge that men with really well-kept beard and a gym body are attractive but i wouldn't find myself being ""attracted"" to them since i prefer clean-shaven men with an athletic body more.

gt95br6,"I mean, I'm saying this from what I've seen too. Like I've known women who have given up heels bcz their partner wouldn't like them being taller than them. I think the entertainment industry is to be blamed here bcz tall boy-short girl relationships are very romanticized. 

That's fair. And in the end the choice is for them to make. If someone doesn't have a problem marrying someone who's seen as ugly, we are no one to say anything. But it's one thing to want a pretty partner, and it's a completely different thing when someone who's really ugly in the conventional sense of it judges someone else on their appearance. I mean technically they could, but I'm certainly gonna be astounded by their audacity. 

Plus appearance, money etc. are all very superficial. But unfortunately, arranged marriages start from superficial aspects and then move on to other things. Like personally, if I'm in love with someone and want to marry them i wouldn't care about their appearance/money that much _but_ in an arranged marriage situation where both of us are judging each other for what we're ""bringing to the table"", it's only fair to want someone who's _at least as_ physically-appealing or financially stable or good at household chores as i am, _if not more_ . It's the bare minimum imo.",1,1,1617464315.0,shelbywhore,False,negative,neutral,neutral,neutral
gt7n7sz,"Nobody is talking about a conspiracy or brainwash, I was expressly trying to tell you it isn't that cartoonishly diabolical. You're also going to an extreme to dismiss it, like, there is plenty of science around advertising, human psychology, and neuroscience is it's own field! 

I do ask my representatives to limit advertising, especially to children, that was once illegal and should be again. My representatives do not listen to me, they are actively working to restrict my ability to even vote, specifically because they want to suppress my ability to be represented or have my interests advanced. 

They use advertising to get and hold office, to great effect. Their advertising targets their voter bases very specifically and they spend billions of dollars researching and studying who to target, how, where, frequency, and what is most effective. 

Advertising works, it's one of the most successful and profitible industries in the world. There is no evil brainwashing conspiracy, just competing companies doing everything they can procedurally over time that they can to gain and advantage and increase sales and value of their businesses and brands or shares. 

As for free will -- that's a seperates thing outside of advertising. Your gut bacteria and other factors outside the brain contribute a great deal to your decision making, if the science of conciousness and free will is interesting to you there's a Radiolab or two on the topic you might enjoy I could reccomend.",1,1,1617421043.0,Khanstant,False,negative,negative,negative,negative
gt7rhma,">Maybe if this SCIENCE as u say was even prevalent, you wouldn't need to torture enemy spies but basically show ads of patriotism of your home country to them and BOOM easy interrogation.

That's literally propaganda - ads pushing your views. And propaganda can be very effective. 

>If it was so bad , y don't u ask ur elected representatives to stop them

Lol. That's like saying if you don't like corruption ask your elected representatives to stop. 

>Just stop and begin to think the implications of what you're saying. That free thought is basically non-existent

This is actually really interesting. You could read about why scientists believe free-will doesn't exist. It's not ads but it is an interesting read at the very least. 

>Coz I believe in personal responsibility more so than anything else.

I think you misunderstand. The idea isn't that people should just give up because their life is controlled by the media. It is exactly the opposite of that. It's a warning - sort of - that the media CAN control your life if you let them, that you NEED to be aware of it and take responsibility for it.

I just feel that if people start blaming stuff on ads for everything without a shred of critical thinking then there's no benefit to it.

And the reason I answered it in such a way is because I've been reading a lot of comments from different people on the same giving ads the power over sexual orientation, sexual preference . Even to the point of handing over their control to ads.
