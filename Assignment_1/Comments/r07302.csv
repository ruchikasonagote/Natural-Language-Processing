hlt1gdl,">after bengal election more than 100 people were kill‚Ç¨d by TMC

Bengali politics has always been violent, bro. Post-independence Congress used to kill Leftists; when they got power, the Leftists killed Congress and TMC; now TMC kills leftists/BJP... whoever is in opposition. 

The reason this happens is that there are very few jobs so people in rural areas depend on govt. funds for local development which get distributed to party workers... so unlike other states where politics is time-pass, local elections are a matter of life and death for these people and after every election, there is a bloodbath by winner on loser. This has been going on for decades but nobody outside Bengal paid much attention and this is getting a religious tint this time because BJP entered Bengal only now and nationalized the election.

Basically, these party workers move from 1 party to another, so the ones who used to be workers for Leftists have now abandoned that party and moved onto the next opposition party which is BJP. At any given time, there will be 1 party in Bengal which is very dominant and the other is under-dog... it used to be Congress vs. Left, then Left vs. Congress, Left vs. TMC, now TMC vs. BJP.",3,5,1637696304.0,leeringHobbit,False,negative,negative,negative,negative
