The generally accepted idea is that since the vast majority of agricultural land is used for feeding livestock, once we phase out livestock, there will be much more room to grow plants. Plants are around ten times more efficient nutrient and energy wise if consumed directly rather than indirectly from animals after-the-fact, a concept called trophic levels. A little over a third of all crops produced in the entire world go solely to feeding livestock, significantly more in countries that raise lots of livestock.

There has been some research done on exactly what a vegan world might look like, namely that it would massively save land and water, and destroy far less of the environment. I would say to look mainly at studies comparing different diets to expected environmental impact, or just any quantifiable time in the future, since those studies will likely be much less biased.

It's important to do your own research and double-check any sources you find. This is true for any topic as long as there's people who care too much about ego and ideology, so not unique to animal rights orgs of course. I've found errors, misrepresentations, even sometimes lies, from very reputable organizations, including PETA. It's good that you're actually looking for sources and trying to analyze stuff on your own, because that's super rare and admirable.

Also hey feel free to message me about veganism or anything vegan related, even like how to cut down on meat/dairy

gykg3m6,"Promoting vegetarianism is almost as harmful as promoting an omni diet, and whatever positive health effects you've personals experienced do nothing for animals or for the planet. For unnecessary reference, I'm vegan, age 27, I have an excellent nutritional profile, and I don't smoke, drink or do drugs. 

I don't know why you're calling me a filthy person for calling you a hypocrite, but at least do me the courtesy of showing how I'm wrong before insulting me. Vegetarianism is not only not nearly enough, but since it harms the planet in an unacceptable and unsustainable way, it is objectively bad. 

Idk where you're getting your definition of vegetarian from, but while it did used to be an all-inclusive term for all plant-based diets, vegans were still referred to as ""strict vegetarians"" who did not use animal products of any kind. If someone was vegan, it was pretty much always specified. Peter Singer talks about his experience as a vegan in the 70's in his book *Animal Liberation*. There are some vegetarians who don't eat eggs, which is common in India, but other than that it refers to those who eat only plants, eggs, and dairy.

If you only eat eggs, and they're ""shit for you"" specifically, then why eat them if you're so healthy? Why get so mad if you only eat eggs? Why bring up all this random stuff in a big crazy rant? I would love to hear more about your decision to eat only plants and eggs, because I've never encountered that before other than from backyard-egg weirdos. I've linked some reading on egg farming's (large) impact on the environment, since you seem to really think you're right on this one.

Also note that ""Eat less meat"" is perfectly acceptable while ""Eat less dairy"" isn't. The implications behind this are interesting.

First of all I don't like the concept of killing or torturing anyone for our food. In vedic Hinduism, vegetarian means avoiding all foods which comes from animals. Not even milk is allowed. Milk is extracted from fresh coconut.
Now a days People are connecting it to people who drinks cow milk and egg and all nonsense. But I support only plant based food and filtered seeds oil. I am much of health conscious guy bro. Even eating egg is like killing a new born. Life is precious whether it's our or any animals. When we consume milk, we snatch the cow's baby milk. And I don't support that at all. I practiced kalaripayattu and I learned our body can survive very well with variety of plant foods.

gyl21gz,"Rastafari Jamaicans also eat no animal products, and take no B12 supplements. Parts of India as well. Apparently if you're vegan (in diet at least) and from a country with lots of untreated food and soil, the bacteria in soil that produce B12 don't die in your body like normal. The pH of your stomach and upper intestines changes and accommodates them, letting them produce B12 for you like they do in animals. The ability to produce B12 goes away once B12-producing vegans move to the West and start eating food there. 

Westerners still have to take B12 tablets, so I do, and the B12 is taken from bacteria in big vats, so no harm to animals or the environment. I'd love to see a future where B12 supplementation is unnecessary for everyone, either by adding it to vegetables directly, genetically engineering stuff to naturally produce B12, or some kind of microbiome pill.

The US has so many health problems caused by what people eat. Obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart problems, diabetes, stroke, any of these alone would be serious, and in many many people here they all occur at once.
