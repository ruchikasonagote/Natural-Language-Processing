Fuck all Religion,f9outu,18849,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9outu/fuck_all_religion/,4076,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Edit. Join /r/atheismindia for more discussion on leaving your faith and coming back to the real world.

"WhiteHatJr filed a 20 CRORE defamation case against me, Pradeep Poonia.",jyt7et,12295,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jyt7et/whitehatjr_filed_a_20_crore_defamation_case/,823,"So WhiteHatJr Filed a 20 CRORE defamation lawsuit against me. 

1. The whole argument from their side is BS. 
2. They finally accepted that Wolf Gupta is imaginary. Why didn't they accept this earlier?
3. Check the document, and see for yourself all their hollow claims. The link at the end.
4. I am looking for lawyers. Got a lot of numbers. Talking to them right now. 
5. One good lawyer suggested I back out, sign an apology and end it, said will cost you 30k rupees only, and that's it. 
6. I won't back out. (Although my parents still don't know what mess I have indulged myself into. But I feel I will be able to handle them.)
7. Why did WhiteHatJr take this risky step? Like it seems like it won't go in their favor in public. Yet they took this desperate step. Because they know what I know and they want me to stop sharing it out there in public. Their lawsuit is to get interim junction and make me stop showing it to everyone. And even try to take down all my videos/posts/Reddit everything.
8. In the past 9 days, I tried if some big publication would write about it. But no one did. (Apart from one, Thanks to [Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/indias-whitehatjr-is-startup-hell/) and Ashish K Mishra for the article).
9. So what is it that they are trying to bury so hard?
10. This spreadsheet, the LIST of all the videos/tweets/links/posts/LinkedIn/Facebook/IG/ quora/Reddit/(9gag also) they reported and took down. The list contains over 700 such links. (If I included the comments of the parents that they were removing, the list would be over 2k)
11. Here is the List: Download, find these people, and tell them what happened to their posts. If your content was also taken down find it here: 
<As per court orders I have removed the link>

12. There is more. The whole company reeks of lies and deceit. Once I said I will find out who Wolf Gupta and who all these fictitious kids are. Now that the media is silent, here is the birth story of such kids and their 'apps'. And you tell me if I was wrong when I called this company a FRAUD. 

<removed after Delhi HC orders on 24/11/2020 >



Neither the kids existed, nor the apps. And they really created a $300 million company around it.

If that is now fraud what it? Now I think now you can understand why the threats, why this case, why they are talking so much risk but not looking at their own mistakes. This proof was shared with one journalist but they ignored it. Now you can understand why the media was silent.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, what do I do here? 

I have three options. 

1. Back out. Apologize and move on. Which I won't.
2. Hire a normal lawyer on my own and they would drag this case and make me exhausted. 
3. As seen in many tweets today, many of you asked me to start a fund and where all can chip in and hire the best lawyer possible. 

Please write in the comments which option should be taken. If option #3, please quote how much can you contribute for real, also suggest to me how to start a fundraiser and what platforms are good for it. WhiteHatJr has already spent 25 lakhs on preparing this case. So legal fights are costly. I alone can only go to a point until my pockets are empty. 

Thanks 

Pradeep Poonia

Some requests:

1. PLEASE don't suggest me to contact Xyz, it takes time. Each email needs to be written accordingly. I would REALLY appreciate if you write emails to different journalist/YouTubers on my behalf. I am already running out of time. A lot has to be in the next few hours.
2. Some one please cross-post this in different subreddutts.
3. WRITE about this issue. Let's not wait for the media. I have posted most of the proofs on youtube and my Twitter. Please write blogs etc about this. Can someone also try to post this issue on LinkedIn, I am banned from there. 
4. Share etc do all that. You see how to spread this news now. Make a small poster kind of thing, those seem to work better than such long texts. 
5. I might not be able to reply to comments and DMs today, please don't mind.

Thanks again

The Lok Sabha is considering asking me to testify, but Reddit gets to go first. Ask me anything.",qo1ol8,9421,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/qo1ol8/i_am_sophie_zhang_fb_whistleblower_when_i_found/,534,"Hi, r/india

I'm Sophie Zhang. At Facebook, I worked in my spare time at Facebook to stop major political figures/parties and world governments from using the platform to deceive their own citizenry - a deeply exhausting task that I've compared to trying to empty the ocean with a colander. When I was fired in September 2020, I stayed up until 8am in the morning to write a 7,800 word internal memo that was [leaked to the press against my objections.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/technology/facebook-manipulation-whistleblower-sophie-zhang.html) [I testified privately](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/social-media-platforms-online-disinforma/product-details/20210210CHE08283) to the INGE committee of the European Parliament in October 2020 even though I was refusing all public appearances, because they asked and my duty to democracy came first. I [went public with the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/12/facebook-fake-engagement-whistleblower-sophie-zhang) in April of this year because the problems of social media will never be solved unless directly confronted. Three weeks ago, I [testified before the British Parliament.](https://time.com/6107835/sophie-zhang-facebook-testimony/)

&#x200B;

I worked across dozens of countries to protect civic discourse - ranging from Argentina to Albania, from India to Iraq, and more. The most pressing of my discoveries occurred when I personally caught the national governments of [Honduras](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/13/facebook-honduras-juan-orlando-hernandez-fake-engagement) and [Azerbaijan](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/13/facebook-azerbaijan-ilham-aliyev) using fake assets to exploit and mislead their own citizenry on massive scales. I was also deeply concerned with Albania, where [an apparent state-sponsored network associated with the ruling Socialist Party](https://exit.al/en/2021/04/23/facebook-whistleblower-sophie-zhang-what-i-found-in-albania-was-so-severe-i-felt-like-i-had-blood-on-my-hands/) was similarly misleading Albanian citizens, but was unable to resolve the investigation before my departure.

In India during late 2019 and early 2020, I found an eventual total of five separate networks of fake accounts across the political spectrum supporting the INC (2), AAP (1), and BJP (2.) The pro-AAP network was acting to manipulate discourse in the Delhi 2020 elections, a fact that was very concerning to myself. Although Delhi is a local state of India, it has a population comparable to small countries such as Taiwan (fortunately I live in the U.S. and aren't in danger from saying this.) I was able to have four out of the five networks taken down (2 pro-INC network, 1 pro-AAP, and 1 pro-BJP.) FB employees approved the takedown of the fifth network, one supporting the BJP, but everything suddenly went silent [after we discovered they were connected to the account of the benefiting MP (meaning that someone with access to the MP's personal account was almost certainly running the fake accounts.)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/15/facebook-india-bjp-fake-accounts)

&#x200B;

My disclosures of these events have led to [considerable](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/facebook-did-not-block-fake-accounts-linked-to-bjp-mp-whistleblower-sophie-zhang-2584773) [recent](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/fb-whistleblower-says-she-will-testify-before-lok-sabha-if-govt-wants-to-look-into-facebook-practices-in-india-1869990-2021-10-27) [interest in India](https://www.indiatimes.com/technology/news/sophie-zhang-facebook-whistleblower-552693.html), including [a call by the Internet Freedom Foundation](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/qgpew6/your_mom_was_right_facebook_is_bad_for_you/) for myself and Frances Haugen to testify before the Lok Sabha. I arranged this AMA when I was being impatient and took the silence from the Lok Sabha to indicate that they were uninterested in calling me to testify. Since then, MP Shashi Tharoor, the Chairman of the Standing Committee on IT, has [publicly announced](https://twitter.com/ShashiTharoor/status/1455150754356813827) [that the committee is seeking approval from the Speaker to allow my testimony.](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/whistleblower-likely-to-depose-before-it-panel/article37291775.ece)

&#x200B;

Separate from this, [I have also written an article on autolikers](https://restofworld.org/2021/sophie-zhang-facebook-autolikers/), which are common in the Global South (including India.) Many Indians sign up for what appear to be free likes, not realizing that by doing so they have given over their credentials to shady middlemen where they may eventually be sold to e.g. an IT cell.

&#x200B;

Because it often results in confusion, I want to be clear that I worked on fake accounts and inauthentic behavior - an issue that is separate from misinformation/fake news/etc. Misinformation depends solely on your words; if you write ""Cats and dogs are the same species"", it doesn't matter who you are: it's still misinformation. In contrast, inauthenticity depends solely on the user; if I dispatch 1000 fake accounts onto Reddit to comment ""Cats are adorable"", the words don't matter - it's still inauthentic behavior. If Reddit takes the fake accounts down, they're correct to do so no matter how much I yell ""they're censoring cute cats!""

&#x200B;

There are genuine questions regarding how to respond to misinformation and hate speech while protecting freedom of speech. But no one serious defends the right of a politician to set up a network of inauthentic accounts supporting himself. Stopping this is necessary to protect freedom of speech, not a violation of those principles - just as stopping ballot stuffing is necessary to protect the sanctity of the ballot and the right to vote.

&#x200B;

If you're interested in other things I've done, I've also written [a guide to whistleblowing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/11/facebook-whistleblower-sophie-zhang-guide), and an op-ed arguing that the [United States is too worried about Russian social media interference](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/18/facebook-fazze-russian-trolls-anti-vaxx-misinformation). If you have personal questions about my life, [there's a profile of me in MIT Technology Review.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/29/1030260/facebook-whistleblower-sophie-zhang-global-political-manipulation/)

&#x200B;

Please ask me anything.  I might not be able to answer every question, but if so, I'll do my best to explain why I can't.

Throughout my existence, Indian people have commented on my dark skin. I've been called everything from Kalu, Kariya to African, Ugandan, Ambrose (somehow that was supposed to be a an insult). I've been asked (forced when I was younger) to use curds, milk, Fair and Lovely, Fairever, Fair and Handsome, Vanishing Cream, cold cream, etc., on my face to make me fairer

Some girls that I expressed interest in told me explicitly that they can't date me because their parents would never approve of a dark skinned guy (many other rejected me for reasons that were not this but that's irrelevant). Shaadi.com and BharatMatrimony.com profile pictures of mine were touched up by a ""professional"" because nobody wants a dark guy. Many women that I met through these websites also had gone through the same experience. It is funny how many similar experiences two dark skinned Indian people have had regardless of their education, wealth, etc., 

My mom, my very own mother discouraged me from going out in the sun too long in the fear that my skin would get darker; of course, she had her own demons to fight with that came from being dark skinned. An aunt would literally differentiate between her two girls as the ""fairer one"" and the ""darker one"". The list goes on... Ironically, it took me moving to the US for people close to me to stop talking about my skin colour on a constant basis

And now I see all these ""righteous"" Indian folks on Indian social media about how America is a hellhole where riots happen, racism happens, their friends had been racially profiled by White people and that we Indians should move back to our own country and escape racism in a racist Western country. And I can help but laugh at the irony. These were and are the same people that still comment about my skin colour  on the WhatsApp group for family or friends or for high school friends or for college friends but when I called them out, all I get is someone who tries to calm me down by saying ""They're your friends/family. They don't have bad intentions""

Fuck off!"

"Help, ideas needed. HLL poisoned my village with mercury. There have been 250 cancer deaths in just 5 years in just my tiny village. Se[r]ious replies only.",38heyu,8051,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/38heyu/help_ideas_needed_hll_poisoned_my_village_with/,256,"I don't want to leave this be, and need some help on which NGO's might be interested in fighting this case.

**Background Reading**

* [Kodaikanal mercury poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal_mercury_poisoning)
* [Unilever's Mercury Fever](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=624)

The summary of these articles would be as follows,

A company called Ponds moved its thermometer factory from the US to Kodaikanal in 1982.

HLL took over Ponds, ran operations till 2001.

A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.

What has been ignored because of lack of visibility is the plight of my village (which I will not name). My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.

I have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 

If you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.

I want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO's...ideas are welcome.

Further studies in case you are interested.

[Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal](http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm). 

[Berijam lake](http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Guest-blog/hanging-in-the-mist-mercury-contamination-in-/blog/47184/).

>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 µg/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 µg/kg and 8.3 µg/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.

>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That's no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.

This article talks about a town 130 Km's away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km's by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam. We are upstream, one of the first major settlements on the river, so the pollution and sewage that eventually killed the river really didn't matter to us. 

Edit - Throwaway for obvious reasons. Don't want this post to be sidetracked by petty partisanship.

edit 2 - Guys, have received PM's from Timesnow. Livemint has contacted the mods, and the mods have provided me a contact id. I have also been contacted (via) PM of an international NGO that looks into such cases.

To be honest I never expected this kind of traction and it is kind of scary now, but I am going to go ahead and email these three entities whatever info it is they require as well as put them onto people in my village.

edit 3 : 6th June 2015, 1300 IST - Guys,  I have initiated contact with 3 Indian Media outlets (big names) who reached out to me. I am now going to go by what they recommend next.

I will keep this thread updated as and when there is a d4evelopment. I have also been approached by 3 reddit users who kindly offered me their labs to test if I need so, but right now, I only have sketchy data to go by (as others here have pointed). I am going to co-operate with the media names and first see if something comes up via their more extensive due diligence.

Thank you. Just to reassure you (that I am not misusing the goodwill of the forum) the issue is real, maybe the cause is not mercury directly, but something is poisoning my village and my post was and remains well intentioned and not a ""troll post"" as a few have alleged via PM."
